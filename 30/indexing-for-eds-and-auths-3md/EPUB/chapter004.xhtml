<p class="noindent"><em><a id="pinpt3"/>Note: This chapter concludes with an index evaluation checklist on page 62 that includes both qualitative issues discussed in <a href="chapter003.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> and the stylistic issues discussed here.</em></p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="pinpt4"/>Editors and authors are sometimes not sure where responsibilities lie when it comes to formatting the index. The answer is really pretty simple: Whoever is responsible for the layout, composition, and formatting of the book as a whole also needs to be responsible for formatting the index. The index needs to match the book in these respects, so it is better (and in the long run much easier) if this job is left to the production editor or compositor.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt5"/>In some cases, such as when authors are working with publishers that expect camera-ready copy or when authors are using desktop publishing, the author will have direct responsibility for formatting. In such cases the author should contact the publisher for specific instructions.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt6"/>Indexers almost never get a chance to contribute to the final appearance of the index, and for good reason. Indexers are not production-end specialists, even if the index is regarded as part of the production aspect of book publishing. Layout is a highly technical process, and it is also idiosyncratic&#x2014;all publishing houses and printers have their own systems.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt7"/>In addition, many indexers are often not very visually oriented persons. We work primarily with text and so are really good at mental conceptualization rather than physical layout. Nevertheless, because we know how indexes work, we do have some ideas about the visual impact of indexes and how they may best be displayed for ease of use. The sections that follow address the issue of formatting as it pertains to specific indexing usability issues.</p>
<section title="What To Expect When The Index Arrives: Style">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-21"><strong><a id="pinpt8"/>WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN THE INDEX ARRIVES: STYLE</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt9"/>The index supplied to the editor by the indexer should generally have all the <em>style</em> elements the publisher requires, but it will not be in the final <em>format.</em> By style, we refer to those elements used in constructing the text, things like:</p>
<ul class="ulindent" epub:type="list">
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt10"/>Punctuation and capitalization</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt11"/>Use of spelling conventions<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p36" title="36"/></li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt12"/>Page range expression</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt13"/>Overall structure</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="pinpt14"/>Formatting, on the other hand, is meant as those elements that fit the text of the index into the book as a whole: column number and width, line breaks, running heads, etc.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt15"/>At the beginning of the project, when the editor or the author first engages an indexer, everyone involved needs to consider some essential elements of style. Most publishing houses have some sort of style sheet or manual, and in some cases particular publications or series of books will have their own specific directions. In other cases, publishers will generally follow a commercially available handbook such as the <em>Chicago Manual of Style.</em></p>
<p><a id="pinpt16"/>In-house style guides do not always provide much guidance on the index, however, and books such as <em>Chicago</em> allow for a wide range of variations in style. Indexers are used to using their own best judgment in terms of making style choices for a particular index. However, if the publisher does have specific indexing style guidelines, it is crucial to provide those to the indexer at the very beginning of the project.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt17"/>Professional indexers now use software that allows them to manipulate text freely, altering, for instance, page range structure (187&#x2013;189 vs. 187&#x2013;89 vs. 187&#x2013;9), literally at the touch of a button. Some style choices affect how the indexer will approach the work, however, and others are more difficult to change once the index is well on its way. So editors and authors need to make sure to give indexers the tools they need to do the job, and the wise indexer remembers to ask about style requirements early on.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt18"/>In fact, well before an indexer is engaged, editors should have a good look at publisher style guides as they pertain to the index. Many have not been updated in years and contain archaic requirements. For instance, more than one publisher style guide states that the index should be submitted double-spaced and in duplicate&#x2014;a paper dinosaur still walking the earth.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt19"/>Most publishers and editors now really want a single electronic file, which they can manipulate at will; they do not require the indexer to double-space it for them, even if they do want to print out the index and mark it up by hand. If a style guide requires updating, many indexers will be interested in helping out with suggestions or will even rewrite the indexing section of the guide for a reasonable fee. Indexers do not mind working without a style manual, but working with an out-of-date one is a nuisance.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt20"/>If there is no style guide, or if the style guide is inadequate, it is not a bad idea to send the indexer a copy of an acceptable index to use as a guide. It will likely answer any questions of style the indexer may have.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p37" title="37"/>
<p><a id="pinpt21"/>Following is a checklist of the style issues indexers face and which issues editors and authors need to think about. Each item is discussed in detail in this chapter. All these items are issues of <em>style,</em> rather than <em>format,</em> and the indexer can and should set them without further tinkering being required by the editor and author. Some can be changed readily by the indexer during or after the indexing process; others are more difficult to alter:</p>
<ul class="ulindent" epub:type="list">
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt22"/>Run-in vs. indented style</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt23"/>Spelling and grammatical conventions</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt24"/>Capitalization</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt25"/>Punctuation</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt26"/>Cross-reference style</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt27"/>Page ranges</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt28"/>Diacriticals</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt29"/>Handling of illustrative materials</li></ul>
<section title="Run-In vs. Indented Style">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt30"/>Run-In vs. Indented Style</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt31"/>Indexes are structured in two basic ways, with some minor variations. In the format known as &#x201C;run-in,&#x201D; sometimes called &#x201C;paragraph&#x201D; style, subentries are run in after the main heading on a continuous line, like this:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt32"/>Dogs: feeding, 97&#x2013;99; nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65; as puppies, 56&#x2013;62; training, 106&#x2013;108; types of, 80&#x2013;87; veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt33"/>Indented style, on the other hand, indents every subhead individually, on its own line:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt34"/>Dogs</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt35"/>feeding, 97&#x2013;99</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt36"/>nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt37"/>as puppies, 56&#x2013;62</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt38"/>training, 106&#x2013;108</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt39"/>types of, 80&#x2013;87</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt40"/>veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103</p>
</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p38" title="38"/>
<p><a id="pinpt41"/>Run-in style saves some space, but it can be much harder to read. Indexers almost always prefer indented style for reasons of usability. Typically, a run-in index can save perhaps half a page to a page in a standard 12&#x2013;18 page index for a 250&#x2013;300 page book. If that slim margin can stop the book from going into an extra folio, of course, it can represent a significant cost saving.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt42"/>If a particular index does not have entries with a great many subheadings, run-in style does not significantly affect usability. In the preceding example, one can pretty quickly read through the run-in entry and find the desired information. Run-in entries with many subheads, on the other hand, can be quite difficult to parse. Try finding the entry for how to train your dog in the two following entries. It is much quicker to run your finger down the alphabetized list than it is to read through the paragraph:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt43"/>Dogs: breeding, 90&#x2013;91; feeding, 97&#x2013;99; hounds, 81&#x2013;82; hunting dogs, 81; hybrids, 84; mixed breeds or mutts, 84&#x2013;85; nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65; as puppies, 56&#x2013;62; purebreds, 84; retrievers, 84; selling, 43; terriers, 85; toy breeds, 82&#x2013;83; training, 106&#x2013;108; types of, 80&#x2013;87; water dogs, 83; working dogs, 83&#x2013;84; veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pinpt44"/>compared with:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt45"/>Dogs</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt46"/>breeding, 90&#x2013;91</p>

<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt50"/>hybrids, 84</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt51"/>mixed breeds or mutts, 84&#x2013;85</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt52"/>nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt53"/>as puppies, 56&#x2013;62</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt54"/>purebreds, 84</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt55"/>retrievers, 84</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt56"/>selling, 43</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt57"/>terriers, 85</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt58"/>toy breeds, 82&#x2013;83</p>

<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt63"/>veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103</p>
</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p39" title="39"/>
<p><a id="pinpt64"/>Run-in style also does not work well if the index includes more than one level of subhead. Say, for instance, that the index includes the different types of dog as a sub-subentry:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt65"/>Dogs</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt66"/>breeding, 90&#x2013;91</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt67"/>feeding, 97&#x2013;99</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt68"/>nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt69"/>as puppies, 56&#x2013;62</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt70"/>training, 106&#x2013;108</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt71"/>types of, 80&#x2013;87</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt72"/>hounds, 81&#x2013;82</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt73"/>hunting dogs, 81</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt74"/>hybrids, 84</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt75"/>mixed breeds or mutts, 84&#x2013;85</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt76"/>purebreds, 84</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt77"/>retrievers, 84</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt78"/>terriers, 85</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt79"/>toy breeds, 82&#x2013;83</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt80"/>water dogs, 83</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt81"/>working dogs, 83&#x2013;84</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt82"/>veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt83"/>That works easily in indented style. But in run-in style, it would look something like this:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt84"/>Dogs: breeding, 90&#x2013;91; feeding, 97&#x2013;99; nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65; as puppies, 56&#x2013;62; training, 106&#x2013;108; types of, 80&#x2013;87: &#x2014; hounds, 81&#x2013;82; hunting dogs, 81; hybrids, 84; mixed breeds or mutts, 84&#x2013;85; purebreds, 84; retrievers, 84; terriers, 85; toy breeds, 82&#x2013;83; water dogs, 83; working dogs, 83&#x2013;84; veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt85"/>The structure and logic of the index is not clear to the user in run-in style once there is more than one level of subheadings.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt86"/>There are variations on run-in style, such as running in only the lowest level of subheadings, which works better than simple run-in:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt87"/>Dogs</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt88"/>breeding, 90&#x2013;91</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt89"/>feeding, 97&#x2013;99</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p40" title="40"/>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt90"/>nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt91"/>as puppies, 56&#x2013;62</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt92"/>training, 106&#x2013;108</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt93"/>types of, 80&#x2013;87: hounds, 81&#x2013;82; hunting dogs, 81; hybrids, 84; mixed breeds or mutts, 84&#x2013;85; purebreds, 84; retrievers, 84; terriers, 85; toy breeds, 82&#x2013;83; water dogs, 83; working dogs, 83&#x2013;84</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt94"/>veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt95"/>Most indexers use software that applies format styles globally, so that one may switch between indented, run-in, and any variations at will. But since format affects usability, most indexers want to know early on what style is required, so as to design a flatter index if the publisher wants strict run-in style.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt96"/>Some publishers have an archaic requirement that the indexer submit the index in indented style, but with all the punctuation necessary for a run-in index. The rationale behind this may be that editors originally found it easier to mark up the index for publication in indented style, which they would then laboriously convert to run-in.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt97"/>This may have been true prior to the electronic age, but with modern editing tools it really should not be necessary, and it makes a lot of extra work for (and requires extra time from) the indexer, not to mention the editor who has to go through and run in all those entries.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt98"/>In any case, if the editor would like an indented version of an index to be published in run-in style for editing purposes, any good indexer can easily provide it. In fact, indexers generally work in indented mode when writing the index because it is so much easier to read, only applying the finished style for the final product; modern software makes it easy to create dual versions.</p>
</section>
<section title="Spelling and Grammatical Conventions">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt99"/>Spelling and Grammatical Conventions</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt100"/>Indexers will follow standard American spelling and grammatical conventions, unless the text of the book being indexed differs dramatically from these (in which case they will generally follow the book&#x2019;s usage). If proofing is still going on while the index is being written, however, indexers may run into inconsistencies they will have to query.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt101"/>In addition, spelling conventions in English display a lot of natural variability. Try Googling &#x201C;copy edit,&#x201D; &#x201C;copyedit,&#x201D; and &#x201C;copy-edit,&#x201D; for example; you will find an equal number of hits for all three.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt102"/>Editors and authors should inform indexers of any general rubrics being used in the book (&#x201C;pre-employment&#x201D; should always be &#x201C;preemployment,&#x201D; for example). This is especially true when working with a multiple-author book with many inevitable variations, if the book has a great deal of specialized vocabulary, or if the book is being written by, say, an American author but will be published first in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p41" title="41"/>the United Kingdom, so the publisher wants the indexer to use British spelling conventions.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt103"/>Indexers running into spelling and grammatical inconsistencies will often query them in an email to the author or editor, especially if the questioned items affect the index directly, such as the spelling of a particular word that occurs in the index.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt104"/>For example, one of this book&#x2019;s co-authors indexed a book that discussed at length the archaeological finds in a town spelled variously as Halicarnassos, Halicarnassus, and Halikarnasos. All of them are acceptable transliterations of the same town name, but they really should be consistent in the text if the readers are going to be sure the author is talking about the same place, and they have to be consistent in the index for alphabetization purposes. It turned out the proofreader had not made them consistent because she was not aware they <em>were</em> the same place.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt105"/>If an indexer does send such a query, editors should respond quickly if at all possible. Otherwise the indexer will have to use his or her own judgment, and the decisions the indexer makes may not match that of the author or editor. Also, it is important to remember that indexers are not proofreaders, and while they may find some items to query, they cannot be relied upon as the final stage in the proofing process.</p>
</section>
<section title="Capitalization">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt106"/>Capitalization</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt107"/>In the previous examples under run-in vs. indented style, you may (or may not) have noticed that the main entry &#x201C;Dogs&#x201D; is capitalized. Capitalization in indexing is a bit like the Pirate&#x2019;s Code: It is more of a suggestion than a rule. Capitalization of the main headings and lowercase for subheadings is a common practice. So is lowercasing both main headings and subheadings (unless they are proper nouns, of course). Lowercase throughout is probably the more modern style these days. In legal and medical indexes, however, sometimes the entire main entry is in upper case.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt108"/>As long as one is consistent, pretty much any capitalization rubrics are acceptable. Indexers can alter capitalization globally after the index is complete. (However, if one is planning to merge the work of several indexers, it is best to make sure they are all using the same capitalization rules from the start.)</p>
</section>
<section title="Punctuation">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt109"/>Punctuation</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt110"/>Indexes do not have a lot of punctuation requirements. Generally one needs punctuation in the following different areas:</p>
<ul class="ulindent" epub:type="list">
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt111"/>After main entries and subentries</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt112"/>Between entries/subentries and page references</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt113"/>In page reference strings</li>
<li class="litop"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p42" title="42"/><a id="pinpt114"/>For special run-in index requirements</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt115"/>To indicate cross-references</li></ul>
<section title="Main Heading Punctuation">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt116"/>Main Heading Punctuation</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt117"/>A main entry or subentry in an indented index, not immediately followed by page references, may or may not have a colon as trailing punctuation. Some people prefer the punctuation because they think without it an entry looks widowed and believe that the punctuation is a way of indicating that related material follows. Others feel that the punctuation is unnecessary and is just something else to proof. See the following examples:</p>

<section title="Page Number Punctuation">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt118"/>Page Number Punctuation</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt119"/>Notice that page numbers are separated from the entries by commas in the preceding examples. This is the almost universally used standard, but exceptions are possible. For instance, some publishers&#x2014;usually in the medical or legal fields&#x2014;use an ellipsis:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt120"/>Celtic lands</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt121"/>Brittany&#x2026;32, 57</p>

</div>
<p><a id="pinpt124"/>Technically you could use almost any sort of entry/page separator, or none at all, but getting too creative can have its drawbacks. People have expectations about how an index should look, and violating those expectations can cause confusion <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p43" title="43"/>and diminish usability. For that reason it is also wise to avoid the temptation some authors and editors feel to right-justify the margin for locators:</p>

<p><a id="pinpt135"/>It is hard to format, and if the column is wide, the eye can stray to the wrong set of page numbers; this format also looks like a table, not an index.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt136"/>Sets of page references for a specific entry are generally separated from each other by commas. However, if the page numbers for a particular project are complex in form (containing a volume number, for instance), you may wish to consider using a semi-colon. The semi-colon gives the eye a bigger target and makes it easier for users to distinguish one page reference from another. It also frees up the comma for other uses:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt137"/>Celtic lands</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt138"/>Brittany, I:32, 57</p>

<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt144"/>Wales, I:95&#x2013;106; II:127</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt145"/>In this example the volume numbers are tied to their page numbers by a colon, a comma distinguishes separate page references in the same volume, and a semicolon separates the entries in different volumes.</p>

<section title="Run-In Style Punctuation">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt146"/>Run-In Style Punctuation</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt147"/>Run-in indexes require one more item of punctuation than indented indexes: They use punctuation to separate subentries. In indented indexes, the subhead is &#x201C;stopped&#x201D; by a line break after the page references, but in a run-in index, the subheads follow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p44" title="44"/>right after each other, so trailing punctuation is important. In theory, any character could be used, but in practice, it is always a semi-colon:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt148"/>Celtic lands: Brittany, 32, 57; Scotland, 22&#x2013;28; Wales, 95&#x2013;106</p>
</div>
</section>
<section title="Cross-Reference Punctuation">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt149"/>Cross-Reference Punctuation</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt150"/>Punctuation in cross-references serves to set them off from entries and subentries. Punctuation between entries and cross-references varies considerably and may even vary slightly within the same index. For a complete discussion of punctuation and other style issues as regards cross-references, see the next section.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Cross-Reference Style">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt151"/>Cross-Reference Style</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt152"/>Cross-references are intended to lead users to the place in the index where the desired information is located. For instance, a user might look up &#x201C;canines,&#x201D; but the information wanted is actually listed under &#x201C;dogs.&#x201D; It is important to add a cross-reference in the index at &#x201C;canines&#x201D; to tell the reader where to look.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt153"/>By the fiat of years of common usage, the accepted way of expressing this is:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt154"/>Canines. <em>See</em> Dogs</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt155"/>But the precise style used may vary considerably.</p>
<section title="Capitalization">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt156"/>Capitalization</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt157"/>Capitalization in cross-references should reflect the conventions of the main entries to which they refer. That is, if the index capitalizes main entries, the cross-reference should, too; if it lowercases them, the cross-references should follow suit.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt158"/>If the main entries are capitalized, the <em>see</em> or <em>see also</em> that indicates a cross-reference looks better capitalized. If the main entries are in lowercase, the cross-reference indicator may be lowercase or uppercase:</p>
<table class="table1a">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="td1">canines. <em>see</em> dogs</td>
<td class="td1">Canines. <em>See</em> Dogs</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><a id="pinpt159"/>Indexers almost invariably italicize the cross-reference indicator (<em>see</em> or <em>see also</em>) itself. The italics serve to mark off the indicator from the entry to which it points. If the index uses generic cross-references or adds additional information about subentries, that material may also be italicized in whole or in part:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt160"/>Dogs. <em>See also specific types of dog, e.g.</em> beagles</p>
<p class="pqph1t"><a id="pinpt161"/>Nutrition for dogs. <em>See</em> Dogs, <em>subhead</em> feeding of</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p45" title="45"/>
<p class="pqph1t"><a id="pinpt162"/>Dogs</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt163"/>nutrition. <em>See subhead</em> feeding of, <em>this entry</em></p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt164"/>While <em>see</em> and <em>see also</em> are almost always italicized, typeface conventions for more complex cross-references vary considerably. As long as the index is consistent internally, most arrangements are acceptable.</p>
</section>
<section title="Punctuation">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt165"/>Punctuation</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt166"/>Punctuation, like italics, serves to set off the cross-reference from the entry. Punctuation may vary considerably, and different types of cross-reference may even be treated differently in the same index.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt167"/>In one standard style, a period separates the cross-reference from the main entry, but cross-references from subentries are set off by parentheses:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt168"/>Celtic lands. <em>See</em> Cornwall; Ireland; Scotland; Wales</p>
<p class="pqph1t"><a id="pinpt169"/>Cornwall, 150&#x2013;156</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt170"/>Arthurian legends of (<em>See under</em> Arthurian legends)</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt171"/>marine coastline of, 152</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt172"/>Authors and editors reviewing the index often flag this as an inconsistency, but as long as it is consistently applied, this format is quite acceptable within the field of publishing. (Readers do not seem to notice or mind; what one picks up when looking at an index consciously for style issues is very different from how the index works at the user level.)</p>
<p><a id="pinpt173"/>However, this style is by no means mandatory. An index may set off cross-references with commas, periods, semi-colons, or parentheses; it may treat all cross-references the same way, or it may differentiate styles for cross-references from main entries, cross-references from subentries, and <em>see also</em> cross-references. As long as the style or styles are consistent and user-friendly, the particular style does not matter.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Cross-Reference Placement">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><em><a id="pinpt174"/>Cross-Reference Placement</em></strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt175"/>Placement of <em>see also</em> cross-references from main entries is also something of a style issue. They may be placed at either the end or the beginning of the subentries.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt176"/>Generally, run-in indexes place <em>see also</em> cross-references at the end of the array, and indented indexes place them at the beginning:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt177"/>Dogs: feeding, 97&#x2013;99; nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65; as puppies, 56&#x2013;62; training, 106&#x2013;108; types of, 80&#x2013;87; veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103. <em>See also</em> specific types of dog, e.g. beagles</p>
</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p46" title="46"/><div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt178"/>Dogs. <em>See also</em> specific types of dog, e.g. beagles</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt179"/>feeding, 97&#x2013;99</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt180"/>nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65</p>

<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt184"/>veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt185"/>The position of the <em>see also</em> can be flipped in both cases, although the result is a little awkward, and in the case of the run-in index requires some tinkering with the punctuation:</p>

<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt186"/>Dogs (<em>See also</em> specific types of dog, e.g. beagles): feeding, 97&#x2013;99; nutritional requirements, 63&#x2013;65; as puppies, 56&#x2013;62; training, 106&#x2013;108; types of, 80&#x2013;87; veterinary care, 99&#x2013;103</p>

<section title="Page Ranges">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt195"/>Page Ranges</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt196"/>Style decisions for page ranges in an index involve two issues: abbreviation and conflation.</p>
<section title="Abbreviation">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt197"/>Abbreviation</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt198"/>Abbreviation allows for some of the characters in a page range to be implicit rather than explicit, allowing for a shorter and, some think, more readable set of locators. Take, for example this entry, for which the page ranges are unabbreviated:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt199"/>Celtic lands, 23&#x2013;35, 40&#x2013;43, 105&#x2013;109, 165&#x2013;172, 192&#x2013;196</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt200"/>It would be perfectly acceptable to express all the page ranges without abbreviation; some publishing houses specify this style, and many people think it is the clearest method.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt201"/>However, if overall space issues or narrow columns are a concern, abbreviating the page ranges is one way to cut down the number of characters in a line. There <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p47" title="47"/>are two main styles for abbreviating page ranges: <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> and <em>Hart&#x2019;s Rules</em>. Here is the <em>Chicago</em> style:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt202"/>Celtic lands, 23&#x2013;35, 40&#x2013;43, 105&#x2013;9, 165&#x2013;72, 192&#x2013;96</p>
</div>
<p><em><a id="pinpt203"/>Hart</em> style allows for additional abbreviation, but some people find it a bit hard to use:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt204"/>Celtic lands, 23&#x2013;35, 40&#x2013;3, 105&#x2013;9, 165&#x2013;72, 192&#x2013;6</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt205"/>You can read more about these specific rules for abbreviating page ranges in the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> and <em>Hart&#x2019;s Rules.</em></p>
<p><a id="pinpt206"/>Some publishers have their own particular specifications for abbreviating page ranges, often based on older editions of <em>Chicago</em> (for instance, some publishers want 105&#x2013;109 abbreviated as 105&#x2013;09). Publishing houses vary as to how closely they follow a set abbreviation style.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt207"/>Fortunately, indexers can set abbreviation styles globally and change them at will using index-dedicated software. However, the wise indexer remembers to enter the range in full in draft mode, so the software can convert the number appropriately.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt208"/>Complex page references, such as those containing volume numbers, may also be abbreviated, but this requires more preparation by the indexer; they are harder to alter later on, so it is wise to discuss and settle upon rules for expressing such page references early in the indexing process.</p>
</section>
<section title="Conflation">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt209"/>Conflation</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt210"/>Page numbers may be conflated into ranges. Say, for instance, an indexer produces the following entry:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt211"/>Beagles, 98, 99, 100, 104, 105</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt212"/>Some people would want to conflate those entries, thus:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt213"/>Beagles, 98&#x2013;100, 104&#x2013;105</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt214"/>Others would conflate only for three entries or more:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt215"/>Beagles, 98&#x2013;100, 104, 105</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt216"/>Most indexers today do not like to conflate references automatically.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt217"/>There is, in fact, a difference between 98&#x2013;100 and 98, 99, 100. The former implies a sustained discussion over three pages; the latter suggests isolated references on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p48" title="48"/>three successive pages. So a reader, finding one versus the other, will expect different things in the text. Nevertheless, if space considerations require it, conflation may be necessary, but it should be undertaken with caution.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Diacriticals">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt218"/>Diacriticals</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt219"/>Diacriticals, or accent marks altering the pronunciation of specific letters (&#x00E9;, &#x014D;, and &#x00E7;, for instance), are not nearly as problematical as they used to be. Nowadays, indexers should be able to reproduce in the index any diacritical marks normally available in Microsoft Word or similar programs.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt220"/>More esoteric diacriticals may have to be represented by some sort of coding system that the production editor will need to convert for final publication. The occasional diacritical is not a problem. Texts containing a great many diacriticals, however, can slow down the indexing process because they can lead to quite a bit of extra keying.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt221"/>Texts involving Hebrew and Slavonic language or culture, using non-Western characters, can prove particularly troublesome. Indexers may charge extra for texts involving a large number of diacriticals. Authors, indexers, and editors should confer about how to handle diacriticals in the index and work out how it will affect timing and price, right at the beginning of the indexing process.</p>
</section>
<section title="Illustrative Materials">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt222"/>Illustrative Materials</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt223"/>Illustrative materials in text&#x2014;maps, pictures, tables, charts, figures&#x2014;may be represented in the index in a number of different ways, from the simple to the elaborate. The simplest method is to include the page numbers on which the illustrative material occurs under its relevant subject matter, without further explication.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt224"/>Let us say that you have a book on churches in Great Britain that discusses Jarrow, now a parish church but formerly the chapel of the monastery in which the Venerable Bede spent his life. It is covered in the text on pages 125&#x2013;130, there are photographs of the interior and exterior on page 132, and there is a diagram of the floor plan on page 127. The indexer could create an entry like this:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt225"/>Jarrow, 125&#x2013;130, 132</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt226"/>That would certainly represent the text to the reader. However, it is often helpful to indicate the presence of illustrative material to the user. One way to do that is to spell it out in subheads, and, indeed, in some older books (presumably with unlimited space) this was done:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt227"/>Jarrow, 125&#x2013;130</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt228"/>floor plan, 127</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt229"/>photographs, 132</p>
</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p49" title="49"/>
<p><a id="pinpt230"/>However, that sort of treatment takes up quite a bit of extra space, especially in a text with a great many illustrations.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt231"/>Another methodology references illustrative material by putting the page numbers for it in a different typeface, usually italic:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt232"/>Jarrow, 125&#x2013;130, <em>127, 132</em></p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt233"/>This has become such a common convention that in many indexes no headnote is provided to indicate what italic page numbers mean. Readers, when asked about such an entry, will almost always say that they assume it indicates pictures or drawings.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt234"/>But what if the editor wants readers to be able to find, say, floor plans only, or just photographs? In such cases, an abbreviation or representative single character may be added to the page number:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt235"/>Jarrow, 125&#x2013;130, 127<em>f,</em> 132<em>p</em></p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt236"/>In this case, a headnote would be required to indicate that italic <em>f</em> indicates a figure and italic <em>p</em> a photograph.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt237"/>This latter methodology requires careful proofing and quite a bit of extra keying for the indexer with changes in and out of italic, but in some books&#x2014;especially art books with many types of illustration that users will be looking for specifically&#x2014;it may be a worthwhile choice. Be aware that the extra effort required may affect the price of the index and the time needed to complete it.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt238"/>If authors and editors find all these style points a bit much to handle, they should remember that they have three approaches available that simplify things:</p>
<ol class="olindent" epub:type="list">
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt239"/>If the publishing house already has an up-to-date index style sheet, it will have to be followed in any case. Just make sure the indexer gets it.</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt240"/>If there is no style sheet, find a mutually agreeable sample index published by the house producing the text, and give it to the indexer as a style guide.</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt241"/>Leave it up to the indexer. Because they are so intimately involved in analyzing the text, indexers already make many stylistic decisions as they build the index, in terms of word choice and phrasing. They will generally be happy to make more general style decisions as well, although they may ask for author or editor input in certain circumstances.</li></ol><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p50" title="50"/>
<p><a id="pinpt242"/>Whatever path you choose, however, it is important not to wait until the index is done and then start making major stylistic revisions. While indexers using modern software systems can manipulate the index pretty freely, some last-minute changes will add time and cost to the project.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt243"/>However, if circumstances mean you do have to make style adjustments after the index has been turned in (say a long lost style guide comes to light), check with the indexer before starting on them yourself. The indexer may be able to save you a good deal of time and trouble (automatically converting one type of page range style to another, for instance).</p>
<p><a id="pinpt244"/>Remember, however, that since indexers work in a database, not in the word processing file they have produced for you, it is expensive (and sometimes not possible) to save any changes you have already made from the word processing file to the indexer&#x2019;s database&#x2014;if you have, for instance, adjusted a punctuation convention for the index, and then want the indexer to change the page range style. Let indexers work whatever stylistic magic they can first, before you start editing and production work on it.</p>

<section title="The Voodoo That You Have To Do: Format">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-22"><strong><a id="pinpt245"/>THE VOODOO THAT YOU HAVE TO DO: FORMAT</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt246"/>Once the indexer turns in the index, the production editor or compositor in charge of putting together the book still has some work to do. Certain parts of the index are closely connected to how the book is put together and the specific pages on which the index will run. The indexer generally is not in a position to set these items and cannot control them, unless asked to produce camera-ready copy for a desktop publisher.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt247"/>Indexers are information retrieval professionals, not layout specialists, and they are generally happy to leave the formatting process to the experts. However, indexers do have opinions on how these issues are finalized. Sometimes the final production process does things to an index that reduces its usability. The following points of formatting can greatly affect the usability and proper functioning of the indexing:</p>
<ul class="ulindent" epub:type="list">
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt248"/>Headnotes</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt249"/>Number of columns</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt250"/>Font size</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt251"/>Indents</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt252"/>Line spacing</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt253"/>Running heads</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt254"/>Continued lines</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt255"/>Widows, orphans, and run-over lines</li></ul>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p51" title="51"/>
<section title="Headnotes">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt256"/>Headnotes</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt257"/>A headnote is an explanation of how the index functions and some of the decisions made during its creation. The headnote can be a simple, single sentence or a long, complex disquisition. Some publishers are keen on headnotes, and others want to avoid them at all costs; many publishers put in their own standardized or customized headnotes. However, if asked, indexers are often glad to write a headnote and in many cases will include one unsolicited.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt258"/>The problem with headnotes, simple or elaborate, is that users often fail to read them. At the helpline of a publisher of legal materials, at least twice a month someone called up to ask why some locator numbers were bold, some were italicized, and some were roman. It was patiently explained to them that bold numbers referred to statutory material, italics to regulatory material, and roman to editorial content, and that this information was provided in the headnote. None of the callers had ever bothered to look at the headnote.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt259"/>Nevertheless, on the off chance that some percentage of users do check for a headnote, including one for index rules that are not immediately obvious is a good idea.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt260"/>Here are some simple examples:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pq-noindent"><a id="pinpt261"/>Page references in <em>italics</em> refer to illustrative material.</p>
<p class="pq-noindent1-top"><a id="pinpt262"/>Individual literary works are indexed under the name of the author.</p>
<p class="pq-noindent1-top"><a id="pinpt263"/>This is an index of subject matter covered in the text. Please remember to check the Index of Names for reference to specific individuals, and the Index of Places for specific geographic locations.</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt264"/>Indexes to complex subject matter may require quite lengthy headnotes because the material itself requires organizational principles that are just not self-explanatory. The following headnote for a text on Jews in medieval Europe, intended for a general audience, explained the often problematic medieval nomenclature:</p>

<p class="pq-noindent"><strong><a id="pinpt265"/>A Short Note on Names</strong></p>
<p class="pq-noindent"><a id="pinpt266"/>The development of surnames in medieval Europe varied considerably from place to place, occurring earlier in Islamic areas and southern Europe. The following rules should help the reader locate persons listed by name in this index. Persons given descriptive titles will be found under their first name: Peter the Hermit is under P. Persons with a geographic identification are listed under their first names: Alexander of Hales is in the A&#x2019;s. Persons very commonly referred to by a title or geographic identification are listed under it: Jean de Joinville, for instance, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p52" title="52"/>is always known as Joinville. Persons with commonly known nicknames are listed under the nickname: Moses ben Maimon is under Maimonides. Cross-references or double-postings are provided at the full name. Persons with the appellation of ben will be found under their first name: Abraham ben Isaac of Lunel is under A. Persons with the appellation of ibn are listed under that element: ibn Tibbon family of Lunel is under I. Persons with a sobriquet beginning ha- or he- are listed under that element: Judah ha-Levi will be found under H. Titled nobility are listed under their first names: Theobald, count of Blois, is under T. Persons with genuine surnames are listed under those surnames: Nicholas Donin is under D, David Kimhi under K.</p>

<p><a id="pinpt267"/>If an elaborate headnote is required, authors and editors should confer with the indexer. Sometimes such a headnote is best written by a potential user rather than the author of the index, but the indexer should at least read it over to make sure it correctly reflects the various index usages.</p>

<section title="Number of Columns">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt268"/>Number of Columns</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt269"/>Inexperienced authors and editors may be puzzled and alarmed when they first open the file sent to them by the indexer. People are accustomed to seeing indexes in multiple columns, but indexers submit their finalized work in a single-column format. Why is that?</p>
<p><a id="pinpt270"/>The indexer really does not have the information or the software to set the precise column width or length needed for the book, and it is easier for the production editor if there are no line breaks or other formatting codes inserted, which he or she will have to remove anyway.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt271"/>If the person reviewing the index wants to get a rough idea of what it will look like in column format, she can easily do this in a Windows program by choosing the &#x201C;Format&#x201D; menu from the toolbar and then clicking on the number of columns and alignment required.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt272"/>Some indexes, those with long lines, actually work better published in single-column format. Wrapped lines&#x2014;main entries or subentries that run to more than one line of text&#x2014;can be hard to read, and getting the indents right takes time and patience. The more columns there are, the shorter the lines of text, and wrapped lines will be more common.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt273"/>However, we are so used to the convention and the look of multiple columns for indexes that it is unlikely a publisher will agree to a single-column format. Given that restriction, how many columns are optimal? It is really a matter of the page size and how long, on average, the index entries are.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt274"/>If the pages are large and the index lines are not too long, a three-column format may work well. But four-column formats&#x2014;used in some art books&#x2014;usually <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p53" title="53"/>result in too many wrapped lines and an index that is hard to read. Most books, especially those of standard 6 &#x00D7; 9 trim, are best with a double-column index.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt275"/>Production editors and compositors need to remember that the index must not only look good on the page, it also has to be user-friendly. The real answer to the how-many-columns question is the ease with which the index is consulted. Evaluation of the final column formatting should always take that into consideration.</p>
</section>
<section title="Font Size">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt276"/>Font Size</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt277"/>The font in which the index is printed should be the same as that of the book. On occasion publishers will issue a book that uses more than one font, but except in unusual circumstances, the resulting look is somewhat unprofessional.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt278"/>Books often use multiple font <em>sizes,</em> however, and the index may very well be printed in smaller type than the text. Publishers do this for two main reasons: It saves space, and it reduces the number of wrapped lines in the multi-columned index, making it, paradoxically, easier to read in smaller type. However, going down to very small type&#x2014;below 9 point&#x2014;can create its own usability problems. Compare these three examples:</p>
<section title="1. Index in 12-point type:">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt279"/>1. Index in 12-point type:</em></strong></h3>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p54" title="54"/>
<figure class="fig-img1"><img src="images/Art_1.jpg" alt="art" /></figure>
</section>
<section title="2. Index in 9-point type:">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt280"/>2. Index in 9-point type:</em></strong></h3>
<figure class="fig-img1"><img src="images/Art_2.jpg" alt="art" /></figure>
</section>
<section title="3. Index in 8-point type:">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt281"/>3. Index in 8-point type:</em></strong></h3>
<figure class="fig-img1"><img src="images/Art_3.jpg" alt="art" /></figure>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p55" title="55"/>
<p class="space-break"><a id="pinpt282"/>The 9-point example is in many ways the most readable. There are fewer wrapped lines than in the 12-point example, but it is still legible for those readers with less than eagle eyes.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Indents">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt283"/>Indents</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt284"/>Main entries, subentries, sub-subentries, and so on are distinguished by how much they are indented. The index submitted to the author or editor will contain the appropriate indents, but when the book is typeset, these may be reset. Unfortunately, the result may be awkward and hard to use.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt285"/>On occasion, it happens that a person who really does not understand an index has left-justified all the indents. In and of itself, that is a good reason to proofread the index after typesetting.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt286"/>The indents may be too shallow:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<figure class="left"><img src="images/Art_4.jpg" alt="art" /></figure>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt287"/>The indent here is so slight as to make it difficult to see the distinctions between a main entry and a subentry. Making the indent too deep, however, can disconnect the subentries from their main entries:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<figure class="left"><img src="images/Art_5.jpg" alt="art" /></figure>
</div>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p56" title="56"/>
<p><a id="pinpt288"/>In addition, this deep an indent may cause subheads to overrun the width of the column, forcing the lines to wrap and lengthening the index. (Indenting wrapped lines is discussed later in the section &#x201C;Widows, Orphans, and Run-Over Lines.&#x201D;) An indent of at least three and no more than six characters per subentry level is usually optimal, but it may be worthwhile playing with the settings a bit to see what looks best.</p>
</section>
<section title="Line Spacing">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt289"/>Line Spacing</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt290"/>Occasionally one comes across an index that simply is not readable. One&#x2019;s eye keeps skipping lines. Indexer Frances S. Lennie offered the insight that this problem is caused by too much line spacing. Some publishers set books at 1.5 line spaces rather than single space, and this can indeed make a text easier to read, especially in certain fonts. But it does not work well in indexes, as you can see by the following example:</p>
<section title="Index with 1.5 line spacing:">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt291"/>Index with 1.5 line spacing:</em></strong></h3>
<div class="pull-quote">
<figure class="left"><img src="images/Art_6.jpg" alt="art" /></figure>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt292"/>Compare the 1.5 line spacing in the preceding example with the single spacing that follows:</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p57" title="57"/>
</section>
<section title="Index with single spacing:">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt293"/>Index with single spacing:</em></strong></h3>
<div class="pull-quote">
<figure class="left"><img src="images/Art_7.jpg" alt="art" /></figure>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt294"/>The single-spaced index is much easier to read&#x2014;and it takes up a good deal less space.</p>

<section title="Running Heads and &#x201C;Continued&#x201D; Lines">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt295"/>Running Heads and &#x201C;Continued&#x201D; Lines</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt296"/>You are dreaming about looking up words in a dictionary, but there are no indicator terms at the top of the page giving you the alphabetical range of the items on the page spread before you. The print is tiny. You try to read the first entry at the top of the left-hand page, but there is no bold print there. You realize the entry actually starts on the page before this one and continues over the page break. Without flipping back a page, there is no way of telling what that block of text is defining&#x0021; It is enough to make any indexer wake up in a cold sweat. Perhaps we exaggerate a bit. But a large and complex index without running heads or continued lines can be a nightmare to navigate.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt297"/>A running head is a guide phrase repeated in the upper and/or lower margin of a book to help readers figure out where they are. In a text these signposts might be the name of the chapter, alternating with the title of the book, plus the page numbers. In the index, running heads may be inserted to indicate the first and last words on a page or page spread. A user looking for information about the Marmara earthquake in the example from the index that follows could find the appropriate page more <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p58" title="58"/>quickly by checking the guidewords in the running heads than by scanning the entries in the index text itself:</p>

<p class="space-break-top"><a id="pinpt315"/>Running heads do not appear in all indexes, but the longer the index is, the more important these guidewords are. Since the indexer does not set the final look of the page, the compositor or production editor should set the running heads, which is accomplished fairly easily with modern book production software.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt316"/>The editor in charge of the whole project, or the author, should remember to specifically request running heads for the index if they believe the book would benefit from it, and if the publishing house does not normally produce running heads for indexes. Indexers should also remember to suggest the use of running heads if they are handling a larger-than-usual project for a client who does not normally use them.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt317"/>You may notice another problem in the preceding example. Remember the final episode in our nightmare? Look at the bottom of the first column and the top of the last. The entry for Marmara earthquake runs over the column break. If one is reading the index like a text, this is not much of a problem. However, most people do not read indexes this way. They consult them, and someone flipping through an index can get confused by an indented line at the top of the second column. It is nearly impossible to format the index so that all columns start with a main entry, so <em>any</em> index, even a small one, is much improved by inserting &#x201C;continued&#x201D; lines:</p>

<p><a id="pinpt328"/>Indexers, authors, and editors should remember to specifically request them, especially for large and complex indexes.</p>
</section>
<section title="Widows, Orphans, and Run-Over Lines">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt329"/>Widows, Orphans, and Run-Over Lines</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt330"/>Proofreaders are taught early to mark up text to correct straying lines, called &#x201C;widows&#x201D; (the first line of a paragraph as the last line of a page) and &#x201C;orphans&#x201D; (the last line of a paragraph as the first line of a page). Indexes also need to be proofed for widows and orphans.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt331"/>In the case of the index, the array (a main heading and its subheads) is a kind of paragraph. A widowed main entry at the bottom of a column, cut off from all of its subheads, or a lone final subhead orphaned at the top of a column, both need a helping hand. It is generally not possible to keep every array together without a column break, but the main entry should have at least one subhead under it, and at least two subheads should stand together (preferably with a guardian &#x201C;continued&#x201D; line, as discussed previously).</p>
<p><a id="pinpt332"/>Indexes are also prone to another sort of line run amok: the run-over or wrapped line. Because of the length of the column compared to the length of the entry, it may not be possible for every main entry or subentry to be kept to a single line. In such cases the line &#x201C;wraps,&#x201D; or runs onto the next line, with a slight indent. In the following example, the subentry is too long for the column it will need to fit:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt333"/>Canaanites</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt334"/>golden calf incident and, 557, 558, 582</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt335"/>historicity of Exodus from Egypt</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt336"/>and, 738, 739, 741&#x2013;744, 745</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt337"/>Israelite religious belief and, 786&#x2013;787</p>
</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p60" title="60"/>
<p><a id="pinpt338"/>When an indexer submits the index, it will be in a format without line breaks. These lines will wrap according to the parameters set in the word processing software but will not be &#x201C;hard&#x201D; or fixed breaks. When the index is typeset, the indent for wrapped lines must also be set. Three potential problems may arise. The indent may be too shallow, easily mistaken for another subhead:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt339"/>Canaanites</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt340"/>golden calf incident and, 557, 558, 582</p>

<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt343"/>Israelite religious belief and, 786&#x2013;787</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt344"/>It may be too deep, so that it looks disconnected:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt345"/>Canaanites</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt346"/>golden calf incident and, 557, 558, 582</p>

<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt349"/>Israelite religious belief and, 786&#x2013;787</p>

<p><a id="pinpt350"/>Or the indent may get left out altogether:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">

<p><a id="pinpt356"/>Wrapped lines need to be inset in such a way as to make their reading comprehensible. They should generally be set so that the indent of the wrapped line is one em larger than the indent for a subhead.</p>

<h1 class="level1" id="h1-23"><strong><a id="pinpt358"/>CARDINAL VIRTUES IN STYLE AND FORMAT</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt359"/>Formatting and style issues may seem like a great deal to handle, but it all boils down, really, to three main issues:</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p61" title="61"/>
<ul class="ulindent" epub:type="list">
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt360"/>Communicate</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt361"/>Experiment</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt362"/>Check</li></ul>
<p><a id="pinpt363"/>Authors, indexers, and editors need to talk to each other about what is best for the index. Even after the index has been turned in and the invoice submitted, authors and editors should have no qualms about going back to the indexer and asking about specific style points.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt364"/>Indeed, most indexers will not mind being asked to have a quick look at the finalized index to make sure it has been laid out properly; indexers almost never get to see it that way unless they are sent a copy of the book.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt365"/>There is also nothing wrong in tinkering a bit with the layout, changing the typeface, experimenting with depth of indent, and seeing how much length adding &#x201C;continued&#x201D; lines will really add to the text.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt366"/>Finally, someone needs to look over the index after layout to avoid embarrassing mistakes that render the index less useful. Potential buyers often check out the index before they purchase a text, and first impressions are important.</p>
