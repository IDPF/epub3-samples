                        needs for clean water, food, work, communication, trade, and transportation. Before
                        there were good roads, boats were the easiest way to travel or send and receive goods.
                        As a result, people often settled near rivers, lakes, and oceans. They also often
                        settled where the land was suitable for cultivation, and the climate was comfortable.
                        You will not find many cities in the frozen wastelands of Siberia.</p>

                            is through social studies. Social studies is an umbrella term. It covers history,
                            geography, economics, government, and culture. History, you probably know, is the
                            study of the past. How clearly can you define the other terms? How do you think
                            they can help you to learn about the world?</p>

                            and accurate definitions. Record any questions you have in a notebook before you

                        <p>For centuries, people in different parts of the world have been trying to get along
                            with one another, not always with success. Part of the problem is a lack of
                            understanding of other peoples ways of life. Advances in communication and
                            transportation, such as the Internet and high-speed planes, have brought people
                            closer together. So have increased international trade and immigration. Knowledge
                            of other societies is the key to understanding them.</p>

                        <p>Social studies is a way to learn about the world. It draws on information from five
                            fields of learning, geography, history, economics, government, and culture. Each
                            field looks at the world from a different angle. Consider the approaches you might
                            use if you were starting at a new school. Figuring out how to get around would be
                            learning your school's geography. Asking other students where they come from is
                            learning their history. Making choices about which school supplies you can afford
                            to buy is economics. Learning the school rules is learning about its government.
                            Clubs, teams, styles of clothing, holidays, and even ways of saying things are
                            part of the school's culture.</p>

                                services. Capital resources are the tools people make, such as machines and

                                <p>Amartya Sen (ah MART yah sen) was born in India. As a professor at Trinity
                                    College in Cambridge, England, he taught and studied economics. An
                                    important part of his research was to look at catastrophes, such as
                                    famine, that happen to the world's poorest people. By showing governments
                                    that food shortages are often caused by social and economic conditions, he
                                    hoped to prevent famines in the future. In 1998, Sen won the Nobel Prize
                                    in Economic Sciences for his research in welfare economics.</p>

                            a flat map, your globe gives you a more accurate view of the world. Best of all,
                            this new globe is programmable. You can input new information about different
                            features and places on Earth. In fact, the manufacturer has set up a contest, the
                            Global Game, giving prizes for the best and most creative approaches to
                            programming the globe. Good luck!</p>

                        <p>Indian troops serving in the army of the British East India Company rebelled today.
                            Reasons given for the revolt include anger at the way the company has been taking
                            over Indian lands and a lack of respect for Indian customs. The immediate cause
                            was the new Enfield rifles issued to the troops. To load them, soldiers have to
                            bite off the ends of the cartridges. Word quickly spread that the cartridges were
                            greased with cow and pig fat. This was an insult to both Hindu and Muslim
                            soldiers. Hindus hold cows sacred and never kill them. Muslims believe the meat of
                            pigs is unclean.</p>

                            <p>The map above shows the major culture regions of the world. Latin America is
                                one culture region. The Spanish and Portuguese languages help to tie its
                                people together. So does its common history. Southwest Asia and North Africa
                                is another culture region. Most countries in this region share a common desert
                                climate and landscape. People have adapted to the desert in similar ways, thus
                                creating a common culture. Islam, which is the major religion in this region,
                                also helps shape a common culture.</p>
                            <p>Usually, not every person in a region belongs to the dominant, or mainstream,
                                culture. Some regions are multicultural. For example, the United States and
                                Canada contain other cultures besides the dominant one. Although most people
                                in this region speak English, many people in eastern Canada speak French. Many
                                people in the United States speak Spanish, especially in the Southwest. In
                                both countries, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and members
                                of other religions all flourish.</p>

                                <p><em>Children Invent Language</em> - In the late 1800s, most people in
                                    Hawaii spoke English or native Hawaiian. In 1880, people began arriving
                                    from other countries to work in the sugar cane fields, and they spoke
                                    Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese.</p>
                                <p>At school, the children of these immigrants began speaking a form of
                                    English that was a blend of native Hawaiian, Pidgin English, Pidgin
                                    Hawaiian, and their native languages, especially Portuguese. Eventually,
                                    children began to learn this form of English as their native langauge.
                                    This was the beginning of Hawaii Creole English, and it soon became the
                                    language of the majority of Hawaiians.</p>

                            <p>For thousands of years, culture regions have changed and evolved as they have
                                borrowed culture traits from one another. They have also come to depend upon
                                each other economically. Decisions and events in one part of the world affect
                                other parts. Advances in transportation and communication have increased this
                                    <a epub:type="keyword" id="gt_10">interdependence</a>. When oil-producing
                                nations in the Middle East raise the price of oil, for example, the price of
                                gasoline at the neighborhood gas station is likely to rise. If there is an
                                especially abundant banana crop in parts of Latin America, the price of
                                bananas may drop at the local grocery store. More and more, people of
                                different countries are becoming part of one world.</p>

                            each day begins. If it is Saturday to the east of the International Date Line,

                    <p epub:type="bridgehead">The Giant Kuafu Chases the Sun</p>
                    <p>FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES, people have created myths and legends to explain the natural
                        world. Some stories explain why earthquakes occur or lightning strikes. Others tell
                        how rivers, deserts, canyons, and other landforms came to be. This ancient Chinese
                        myth, dating back at least 2,500 years, comes from the area of northern China where
                        Chinese civilization first began. The myth explains how the province of Shaanxi got
                        its mountains.</p>
                    <p>Shaanxi, also known as Shensi, is in northern China.The southern part of the province
                        contains the high and rugged Qinling Range, also called the Tsinling Mountains, where
                        the average peak is 8,000 feet high and some are over 12,000 feet high.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Long ago, soon after time began, giants roamed the flat and fertile Earth. One of the
                        largest, bravest, and fastest of them all was named Kuafu-and his strength knew no
                        bounds. Every day, Kuafu watched the sun rise in the east and set in the west.When
                        night came, he became greatly saddened. He thought, "I do not like the darkness. All
                        life falls into a silent slumber. If I could catch the sun, then I could keep night as
                        bright as day. The plants could grow forever, and it would always be warm. I would
                        never have to sleep again."</p>
                    <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="29" id="p29"></span>
                    <p>The next day, Kuafu stretched his legs and started to race after the sun. He ran like
                        the wind over several thousand miles without rest. Finally, he chased the sun to the
                        Yu Valley where it came to rest every day but Kuafu was thirsty and very, very tired.
                        His thirst grew, and soon it became overwhelming. He had never known a thirst like
                        this, and his body seemed to be drying up like mud bricks in an oven.</p>
                    <p>Kuafu found the nearest stream and drank it dry. It was not enough.With a giant's
                        stride, he quickly reached the mighty Yellow River. He drank it dry, but again, it was
                        not enough. He continued toward the Great Sea-surely it held water enough to quench
                        his thirst.</p>
                    <p>On his journey, he drank dry every well and every stream and every lake he came across.
                        His thirst became overpowering, and Kuafu fell to the ground before he reached the
                        Sea. In a fit of anger, with a branch of a peach tree, he made a final swing at the
                        sun. But before the branch reached the sun, Kuafu died of thirst.</p>
                    <p>The sun set in the Yu Valley, and night came. When the sun rose again, Kuafu's body had
                        been transformed into a mountain range. The peach tree branch extended from his side
                        and formed a peach tree grove.To this day, the peaches in this grove are sweet and
                        moist, always ready to relieve the thirst of those who would choose to chase the
                        sun.</p>
