					<li>
                      
                        
                         <p>JIS X 4051 defines two methods for illustration positioning: "relative position specification" and "absolute position specification".
                              Below the definitions from this standard are described.
                         </p>
                        
                        
                           
                           <p>Relative position specification: the specification of block units appears together with the flow of, say, paragraphs of the
                              main text within lines. The lines are the basis for positioning, and segmentation of the line feed is not possible. ("block
                              unit": a general term for blocks of figures, images etc. and tables)
                           </p>
                        
                        
                           
                           <p>Absolute position specification: the specification of block units appears within the hanmen or spread. An absolute position  based
                              on these is the basis for illustration placement.
                           </p>
                        
                        
                           
                           <p>In the case of <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_illustrations.xhtml#fig3_1-en">Fig. 4.79</a>, where the position is specified from two directions (from the head or the fore-edge), the absolute position specification
                              method is used.
                           </p>
                        
                      
                        
                         <p>As shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_illustrations.xhtml#fig3_2-en">Fig. 4.80</a>, <a class="figure_ref" href="requirements_for_illustration_positioning_in_horizontal_layout.xhtml#fig3_9-en">Fig. 4.88</a> or <a class="figure_ref" href="requirements_for_illustration_positioning_in_horizontal_layout.xhtml#fig3_10-en">Fig. 4.89</a>, when the position in the inline direction is given as specified, and the position in the block direction is determined depending
                              on the position of the main text which refers to the block unit, the adopted method is  relative positioning (of course
                              absolute positioning is possible too for placement at the head or foot ).
                         </p>
                        
                        
                           
                           <p>Furthermore, JIS X 4051 defines the placement of the specification method for gutter and fore-edge with absolute positioning
                              method, but not with relative positioning. It is desirable to allow for a positioning based upon a specification method of gutter and fore-edge, also for relative
                              positioning.
                           </p>
                        
                     </li>
					<li>
                        
                           
                           <p>When both  the main text (or the main paragraph in JIS X 4051 terminology) and the illustration are on the same page, either
                              method does not raise any problem unless there is only a single line of the main text to be laid out before the illustration
                              in the block direction on the top of the content page area or after the illustration at the bottom as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="requirements_for_illustration_positioning_in_vertical_mayout.xhtml#fig3_6-en">Fig. 4.85</a> or in <a class="figure_ref" href="requirements_for_illustration_positioning_in_horizontal_layout.xhtml#fig3_11-en">Fig. 4.90</a>. The problematic cases are where, via the relation to the corresponding text or the size of the illustration, the illustration
                              juts out of the the hanmen or the area of the column, or the page of the main text and the page of the illustration are different.
                              About these issues JIS X 4051 makes the following definitions.
                           </p>
                        
                        <ol>
                           <li>
                              
                                 
                                 <p>With the relative positioning method, the illustration is placed directly after the line in which the anchor in the main text
                                    is defined. If, as a result of the positioning, the illustration juts out of the hanmen or the column, the length of the part of
                                    the illustration inside the hanmen or the column (a), and the part outside the area (b) will be compared (see <a class="figure_ref" href="basic_ideas_about_illustration_positioning_in_JISX4051.xhtml#fig3_13-en">Fig. 4.92</a>). Since it should be avoided (if possible) that an illustration appears before its explanation in the main text, the comparison
                                    uses not a simple 1/2, but a relative weight. If concretely like in <a class="figure_ref" href="basic_ideas_about_illustration_positioning_in_JISX4051.xhtml#fig3_13-en">Fig. 4.92</a> the relation between <i class="quantity">a</i> and <i class="quantity">b</i> is <i class="quantity">a</i> ≧ 2<i class="quantity">b</i>, the illustration is placed on that page (in the final stage), and the lines which overlap with the area of the illustration
                                    (including the line with the anchor) are put on the following page, they are put out (see <a class="figure_ref" href="basic_ideas_about_illustration_positioning_in_JISX4051.xhtml#fig3_14-en">Fig. 4.93</a>).

                                          <p>It is not  in every case  the right approach to set the relative weight of  parts outside the area and inside the area to 1/3 (1:2).
                                             Consequently, it is safe to assume that these proportions can be modified. Nevertheless, when specifying 1/3, many cases can
                                             be matched.

                                 <p>With the absolute positioning method, a stranded line before or after the illustration in the block direction can be predicted
                                    and hence avoided. In contrast, with the relative positioning method, it happens that a stranded line in the block direction
                                    is left out as a result. This is bad style, and JIS X 4051 defines a processing method for avoiding it.

                                 <p>Several elements come in between e.g. paragraphs, and it is necessary to adapt the area of the hanmen size
                                    in the block direction. For this case, there are several approaches about style designed via the kihon-hanmen (character size, line
                                    spacing etc.) and different style elements: the approach of unifying the space around such elements, or the approach of maintaining
                                    (if at all possible) the position of lines specified during the design of the hanmen. JIS X 4051 defines two methods for this topic
                                    (see section <a class="sec_ref" href="block_direction_setting_process_of_lines_paragraphs.xhtml#block_direction_setting_process_of_lines_paragraphs">4.5 Block Direction Setting Process of Lines, Paragraphs etc.</a>).

                                    is inserted in the free area, it is necessary to adapt the line length to integral multiple of the characters used. Such aspects are
                                    defined in JIS X 4051 as well (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_illustrations.xhtml#fig3_1-en">Fig. 4.79</a>).

                                 <p>Also, if the number of surrounding characters is extremely low, it is better to keep the surroundings free. If the number of
                                    surrounding characters is 1/4 of the line length of the kihon-hanmen or 9 characters below, JIS X 4051 specifies that no main text should surround
                                    an illustration.

                                    and below the illustration. JIS X 4051 also provides definitions for this aspect (see <a class="figure_ref" href="basic_ideas_about_illustration_positioning_in_JISX4051.xhtml#fig3_20-en">Fig. 4.99</a>).
