Note that the amount of line indent after the line feed (the first line indent of a new paragraph) is assumed to be a <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.one-em-space">one em space</a> across all the patterns.</p><ol>
					<li>
   
    
    <p>The first line indent after the line feed is set full-width (one em) and the next line after the first line break starts with no space (so-called <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.tentsuki">tentsuki</a>) (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_opening_brackets_at_line_head.xhtml#fig2_15-en">Fig. 3.15</a> ①).</p>

    <p>The first line indent after the line feed is set one and a half em and the next line indent after the first line

								<p>Because the inherent character width of a bracket is half-width, <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_opening_brackets_at_line_head.xhtml#fig2_15-en">Fig. 3.15</a>
① can be explained as the result of applying the principle that any line should start with no space. On the other hand, the principle represented by <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_opening_brackets_at_line_head.xhtml#fig2_15-en">Fig. 3.15</a>
② is to assume that opening brackets should be always accompanied by the preceding half em
space
as if they were full-width and then apply the same principle as in <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_opening_brackets_at_line_head.xhtml#fig2_15-en">Fig. 3.15</a>
①. JIS X 4051 adopts the principle shown in ① (the patterns shown in ② is offered as options) . The pattern shown in ③ was first invented in books such as novels, which use frequent line feeds and corner brackets in dialogues, for which the first line indent with one em

	space
or one and a half em
space
(then this pattern was accepted and adopted by general books). Major Japanese publishers who deal with literature, such as Kodansha, Shinchosha, Bungei Shunju, Chuoh Kouronsha, and Chikuma Shobo, have adopted the pattern shown in ③. By contrast, Iwanami Shoten and other publishers adopted the pattern shown in ①. Because Iwanami Shoten once adopted pattern ② in vertical composition, there used to be many examples of it, but few examples of ② can be found today.</p>

								<p>The first line indent of a new paragraph is full-width in principle. However, the following exceptions can be found.</p>

     <p>The most popular scheme is to set the first line indent of all new paragraphs to full-width. However, even if there is a paragraph break and the new line looks  like the beginning of new paragraph,  in contexts where the new line is a continuation of the preceding  line, the new line is set tentsuki as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_opening_brackets_at_line_head.xhtml#fig2_16-en">Fig. 3.16</a>. (There are books such as novels which adopt full-width line indent without exception.) Similarly, in horizontal writing mode, the line indent is set tentsuki where the new line continues the preceding line of a mathematical expression connected by conjunctions such as "therefore".</p>

     <p>When <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.heading">headings</a> have no line indent, the first line indent of the first paragraph after the heading can be also
     set tentsuki, for cosmetic reasons. However, it is not recommended to set the first line indent to tentsuki for all paragraphs,
     because it would make paragraph breaks unclear.
