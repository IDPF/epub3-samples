                     </p><ol>

                           <p>In books, the spread is the basis for the design, and the illustration position is specified towards the head and fore-edge.
                              Hence it is necessary to use the spread as the basis for the specification of the position. Concretely it means that the position
                              has to correspond to "towards the fore-edge" or towards the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.gutter">gutter</a>.
                           </p>
                        
                     </li>
					<li>
                        
                           
                           <p>In vertical layout, often the upper part of an illustration touches the head of the hanmen, or the left or right part touches
                              the fore-edge. This makes it necessary to position the illustration relying on the hanmen (or the final size). Furthermore, even
                              if the complete hanmen is occupied by the illustration, depending on the illustration content, in some cases it is better style
                              to  position the illustration about 1mm inside the hanmen.
                           </p>

                                    <p>The reason for the positioning 1mm inside the hanmen is that in that way, the character area of the hanmen and the illustration appear
                                       to be arranged together.

                           <p>As said in "b", normally, it is appropriate to specify a position starting from the hanmen. However, in the case of a <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.bleed">bleed</a>, it is necessary to jut out of the final size to position the illustration (see <a class="figure_ref" href="page_wise_arrangement_of_kihonhanmen_elements.xhtml#fig_ad1_8-en">Fig. 2.39</a>). Furthermore, in such cases it is possible to specify an intuitive position, if  the specification of the position uses the edge of
                              the trim size as the origin (see <a class="figure_ref" href="requirements_for_illustration_positioning_in_vertical_mayout.xhtml#fig3_4-en">Fig. 4.82</a>).

                           <p>If base text is placed around illustrations, normally the smallest space size between them is specified. The smallest space size is
                              the character size used for the main text (which is specified for the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.kihon-hanmen">kihon-hanmen</a>), or the line gap (also specified for the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.kihon-hanmen">kihon-hanmen</a>). It is also necessary to specify the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.line-length">line length</a> of surrounding text as  an integral multiple of the character size in use.

                                    <p>If possible, it is appropriate to unify the space between illustrations and surrounding main texts. For example it can be unified
                                       to be 1.5 times  the character size used in the main text. Depending on the size of the illustration it may be that
                                       such unification is not possible, since it is necessary that the line-length be an integral multiple of the character size in use.
                                       But, at the design step, some modifications of the illustration size are possible. Accordingly it is possible to unify the
                                       space around illustrations, by creating an overview of the various sizes of illustrations and the related numbers of characters
                                       and lines, and choose from that overview the applicable numbers and apply these during the design step.

                              of the kihon-hanmen or less than 9 characters), it is better to not place the characters and leave the space free (see <a class="figure_ref" href="requirements_for_illustration_positioning_in_vertical_mayout.xhtml#fig3_5-en">Fig. 4.84</a>).
