   When <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.mono-ruby">mono-ruby</a> characters are Japanese, they are <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.solid-setting">set solid</a>. If mono-ruby characters have their own character widths such as
   Western characters or <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.european-numerals">European numerals</a>, they are set according to their own widths and then the ruby text is placed so that its center
   matches that of its base character. There are more variations depending on the combination of the base character
   and ruby text and accordingly various composition rules have been invented, which will be explained with examples.
</p><p>
   When attaching two <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby characters to a single base character, the lengths of the ruby text and the base text are the same and they are positioned as shown
   in <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_13-en">Fig. 3.62</a>.

   When attaching a single <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby character to a single base character, there are two ways of positioning the ruby character.
</p><ol>
					<li>
   
    
    <p>
    In <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.vertical-writing-mode">vertical writing mode</a>, attach a ruby character so that its vertical center matches that of the base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_14-en">Fig. 3.63</a>).
    In <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.horizontal-writing-mode">horizontal writing mode</a>, attach a ruby character so that its horizontal center matches that of the base character (see
    <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_14-en">Fig. 3.63</a>).
    This positioning of a ruby character is called '<a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.nakatsuki">nakatsuki</a>' (center-alignment).
</p>

   </li>
					<li>
   
    
    <p>
    In vertical writing mode, attach a ruby character so that the top of its virtual body is aligned with the top of that of the base
    character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_14-en">Fig. 3.63</a>). This positioning of a ruby character is called 'katatsuki' (top-alignment).
    For horizontal writing mode, '<a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.katatsuki">katatsuki</a>' should not be adopted. If a ruby character is attached so that the left-edge of its virtual
    body is aligned with the left-edge of that of the base character, it would result in the loss of the center of balance, which
    doesn't look good (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_15-en">Fig. 3.64</a>).

     Katatsuki alignment was commonly used in the <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.letterpress-printing">letterpress printing</a> era, but today the adoption of nakatsuki alignment is increasing
     even in vertical writing mode. However, there is still an opinion favoring katatsuki alignment, because it is familiar and
     readable.

   When attaching three or more <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby characters to a single base character, the ruby characters are set solid. In this
   case, where the length of a ruby text is longer than that of its base character, positioning of the ruby text depends
   on which alignment has been adopted for a single ruby character. There is another issue: how to maintain the spatial balance
   of the ruby characters hanging over those characters which are not related base characters. The adjustment of inter-character
   spacing for those characters which come before and after the base character will be explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters.xhtml#adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters">3.3.8 Adjustments of Ruby with Length Longer than that of the Base Characters</a>.

    <p>
    When nakatsuki alignment is adopted for a single ruby character, position a ruby text so that its vertical center is aligned
    with that of its base character in vertical writing mode (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_16-en">Fig. 3.65</a>). In horizontal writing mode, position a ruby text so that its horizontal center is aligned with that of its base character
    (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_16-en">Fig. 3.65</a>).

    When katatsuki alignment is adopted for a single ruby character, there are two methods, as follows.
</p>
   
   <ol>
    <li>
    
     
     <p>
     Position the ruby text so that its vertical center is aligned with that of its base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_16-en">Fig. 3.65</a>).</p>
    
    </li>
    <li>
    
     
     <p>
     Depending on the type of script of the adjacent characters to the base character, and the number of ruby characters, a decision
     is made about whether  ruby hangover is allowed on the character before its base character, or on the character after, or
     on both adjacent characters. At break-even situation, the hangover is usually on the character after its base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_17-en">Fig. 3.66</a>).

     The terms katatsuki and nakatsuki were originally used for ruby alignment only when a single ruby character is attached
     to a single base character. However there are cases where the meaning is stretched so that the terms can be used when
     three or more ruby characters are involved. We use the terms katatsuki and nakatsuki with their original meaning throughout
     this document.

     The preference for the choice of hanging the ruby over the character after its base character is due to the preference
     to avoid adjustment of inter-character spacing between base characters and their adjacent characters, which was common
     in letterpress printing.
