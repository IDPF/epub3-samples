   When the length of any ruby text is shorter than that of the base characters, the main text can be just set solid because
   there is no need for any adjustment of the inter-character spacing between base characters  and
   their adjacent characters in the main text.</p><div class="figure" id="fig2_3_29-en"><div class="figure-float"><div><img alt="Set solid when the length of ruby text is shorter than that of base characters." width="153" height="325" src="../image/Images-en/img2_3_29.png"/><div class="figureCaption">Fig. 3.78: <span class="caption-body">Set solid when the length of ruby text is shorter than that of base characters.</span></div></div></div></div><p>
   When the length of the ruby text is longer than that of the base characters, the method of composing the main text depends on how
   much the ruby text hangs over the <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.xhtml#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> or <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.punctuation-marks">punctuation marks</a>, which are  attached to the base
   characters. The following are the general rules (see <a class="figure_ref" href="adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_30-en">Fig. 3.79</a> and <a class="figure_ref" href="adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_31-en">Fig. 3.80</a>). They were established especially in order to avoid misreading and to maintain the beauty of the layout.
Noted that the detailed value of spaces between characters for cases of ruby letters hanging over the base characters is described in <a href="spacing_between_characters.xhtml#spacing_between_characters">"Appendix B Spacing between Characters"</a> as Table 1 in accordance with <a class="sec_ref" href="about_character_classes.xhtml#about_character_classes">3.9 About Character Classes</a>.

								<p>Because ruby letter may go over the base characters and overhang to adjacent <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> etc. up to the full-width size of a ruby letter, ruby letters from before and from after a base <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> may be consecutive without space like <a class="figure_ref" href="adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_29_2-en">Fig. 3.81</a>. Such cases are not recommended because of the possibility of misreading. It is recommended to insert one em space between former ruby letters and latter ruby letters. There are to ways to carry out this. One is to reduce the maximum size of overhang to the <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> base character of before ruby letter and after ruby letter, and the other is to reduce the maximum size of overhang to the <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> base character of after ruby letter. The latter case is carried over to differently set the limit of overhang from before and from after. Firstly, set the ruby letters from before as usual, i.e. ruby letter may overhang up to the full-width size of a ruby letter. Secondly, ruby letter from after shall be set with one em space before, namely, the ruby letter from after can not go over the base <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> letter in between. Hence, appropriate size space shall be inserted between base characters themselves (see <a class="figure_ref" href="adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_29_3-en">Fig. 3.82</a>).</p>
