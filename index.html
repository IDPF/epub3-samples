            <h2>EPUB 3 Samples Project</h2>
            <p>The EPUB 3 Samples Project provides a collection of EPUB 3 publications intended to showcase features of the
                specification and to provide testing materials for reading system developers.</p>
            <p>The site is maintained by the W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/epub3/">EPUB 3 Community
                Group</a>.</p>

                <h3>EPUB 3.1 Samples</h3>
                <p>A <a href="31/samples.html">table of samples</a> is available that describes the sample 3.1 publications
                    and provides links to obtain their source.</p>
                <p>The samples are available in both expanded and packaged form to simplify the review of markup patterns and
                    facilitate testing in reading systems. The expanded source is maintained in the EPUB 3 Samples Project's
                        <a href="https://www.github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples/">github repository</a> under the <a
                        href="https://www.github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples/tree/master/31/">"31" directory</a>. Individual
                    downloads are available from the <a href="https://github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples/releases">releases
                        page</a>.</p>
                <p>A <a href="31/feature-matrix.html">feature matrix</a> has also been developed that charts which
                    publications in the samples project exhibit which features of EPUB 3.1.</p>
