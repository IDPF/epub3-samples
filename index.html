                <h2>EPUB 3 Samples Project</h2>
                <p>The EPUB 3 Samples Project provides a collection of EPUB 3 publications intended to showcase features of the specification,
                    and to provide testing materials for reading system developers.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>Samples</h3>
                    <p>A <a href="samples.html">table of samples</a> is available that describes each publication and provides links
                        to obtain their source.</p>
                    <p>The samples are available in both expanded and packaged form to simplify the review of markup patterns and 
                        facilitate testing in reading systems. The expanded source is maintained in the EPUB 3 Samples Project's
                        <a href="https://www.github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples">github repository</a>, while individual downloads
                        are available from <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9g8D2Y-6aPLflIyZE50Um50cG5BNkZSQ2NqcVhtUlZJSGRoVWhla3ktZ2JQdDJjdFNyZlk">Google Drive</a>.</p>
