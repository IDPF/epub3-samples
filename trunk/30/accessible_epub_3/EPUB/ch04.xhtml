			<h2 class="title">Chapter 4. Conclusion</h2>
			<p>EPUB 3 holds out much promise, but only if you care about the quality of your content
				and actively work to make it better. If I’ve done my job, though, accessibility is
				hopefully no longer a foreign concept or impossible-sounding ideal anymore. It’s
				fundamentally about high-quality data, with hooks in for people who can’t consume
				the content in its native format, whether auditory or visual.</p>
			<p>The people you need to produce accessible EPUBs are not hard to find, either. Web
				content developers abound as the internet generation comes of age. And unlike in the
				early dark days of web accessibility, more and more people are learning WCAG and
				WAI-ARIA guidelines for accessible production. They’re not skills you can ignore as
				a developer, as so much basic accessibility legislation is premised on them now.</p>
			<p>My point, however, is only that creating accessible EPUB 3 publications is not a
				costly proposition. It doesn’t require seeking out highly-specialized skills that
				won’t provide you a return on your investment. Reflowable web content is the
				direction publishing is heading in, and well down the road to.</p>
			<p>But to wrap up, no guide can ever make you take action, only impart some measure of
				knowledge. Assuming I’ve met that threshold, the onus is now on you to take what
				you’ve learned and put it to good use.</p>

					<p>The new EPUB 3 specification from the IDPF incorporates a wide range of
						technologies and functionality that are set to revolutionize electronic
						publishing. The format is poised to make the static two-dimensional page a
						thing of the past, introducing the world to new rich multimedia reading
						experiences and scripted interactivity. But a specification that offers so
						much can be a daunting thing to learn.</p>
					<p>EPUB 3 Best Practices steps in to help fill the knowledge void. Authored by
						people involved in the development of the specification, and with extensive
						experience in electronic publishing, this guide will provide you with a
						solid foundation on which to begin developing your own EPUBs. Topics covered
						include:</p>
					<ul class="itemizedlist">
						<li class="listitem"><p> A comprehensive survey of accessible production
								features and best practices </p></li>
						<li class="listitem"><p> A walkthrough of the new global language support
								features </p></li>
						<li class="listitem"><p> An introduction to the new multimedia elements and
								how to use them to embed content </p></li>
						<li class="listitem"><p> A guide to best practices for authoring of
								interactive elements and scripting </p></li>
						<li class="listitem"><p> A review of publication and distribution metadata
							</p></li>
						<li class="listitem"><p> Techniques for fixed and adaptive layouts </p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>EPUB 3 Best Practices is a must-read for anyone looking to unleash the
						potential of the new format.</p>
