However, sometimes exceptions arise as follows:</p><ol>
					<li>

<p>Paragraphs and other objects set using a different character size or line gap from the kihon-hanmen. If there is no adjustment, the bottom of the last line will not be aligned to the bottom of the kihon-hanmen or column area in the block direction. Examples are block headings and end notes  inserted after a paragraph.</p>
</li>
					<li>

<p>When setting objects which are prohibited at the bottom of a kihon-hanmen or the bottom of a column, such as block headings,  some blanks may appear on the previous page or in the previous column.</p>
</li>
				</ol><p>In these cases, there are two ways to solve the issue. Hereafter, procedure (a) will be called "adjustment processing in block direction".</p><ol>
					<li>

<p>Set  the bottom of the line aligned to the bottom of the kihon-hanmen or the bottom of the column  in the block direction, and move blanks to appropriate positions within the kihon-hanmen or the column.</p>
</li>
					<li>

<p>Let the blanks appearing at the bottom of the hanmen or the column in block direction remain as they are.</p>
</li>
				</ol><p>There are some issues related to the adjustment procedure in the block direction as follows:</p><p>First,  make best efforts to reduce such cases.
				  Some examples of how not to let objects affect the alignment to the kihon-hanmen lines of following objects are:</p><ol>
					<li>
					
						
						<p>Block heading:  the  area of the block heading is specified by an integral number of lines (see <a class="sec_ref" href="processing_of_gyoudori.xhtml#processing_of_gyoudori">4.1.6 Processing of Gyou-dori</a>).</p>
