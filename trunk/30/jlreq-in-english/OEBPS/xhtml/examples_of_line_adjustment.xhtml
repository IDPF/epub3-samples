However, since layout processing
   of punctuation marks is one reason for the need for line adjustment processing, we will here introduce two main examples of cases where
   line adjustment processing is necessary, and show adjustment examples (see  <a class="figure_ref" href="examples_of_line_adjustment.xhtml#fig2_33-en">Fig. 3.33</a>).</p><ol>

    <p>The principal approach in Japanese composition is that with the exception of the last line of a paragraph, the length of all lines
    is the same, so all lines are aligned. As explained before, the line length is set to be n-times the character size established for the kihon-hanmen. Hence, as long as only full-width
    characters are used, all lines have the same length (see ① at <a class="figure_ref" href="examples_of_line_adjustment.xhtml#fig2_33-en">Fig. 3.33</a>).</p>
   
   </li>
					<li>
   
    
    <p>In <a class="figure_ref" href="examples_of_line_adjustment.xhtml#fig2_33-en">Fig. 3.33</a>
at ②, there is an <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA "、"</span>
followed by a <span class="character">LEFT CORNER BRACKET "「"</span>, and  the total space taken by the two characters is one and a half em. That means that the line overshoots or runs short of the edge of the kihon-hanmen by a half em. To restore a uniform line length, line adjustment is applied as shown at ③ in <a class="figure_ref" href="examples_of_line_adjustment.xhtml#fig2_33-en">Fig. 3.33</a>. The <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.half-em-space">half em space</a> overshoot or shortage is recovered by <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-reduction">reducing inter-character space</a> to a quarter em before the <span class="character">LEFT CORNER BRACKET "「"</span> and after the <span class="character">RIGHT CORNER BRACKET "」"</span>.</p>
   
   </li>
					<li>
   
    
    <p>At ④ in <a class="figure_ref" href="examples_of_line_adjustment.xhtml#fig2_33-en">Fig. 3.33</a>, the 15th character is an <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.xhtml#cl-01">opening bracket (cl-01)</a>. This should not appear  at the line end. Ideally, a full
 width space reduction would be applied, and the character "前" on the second line would be moved onto the first line in the
 15th position. In that way, the problem could be avoided. However, in this example a full-width space reduction is not possible,
 so line adjustment processing is applied as shown at ⑤ in <a class="figure_ref" href="examples_of_line_adjustment.xhtml#fig2_33-en">Fig. 3.33</a>. The <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.xhtml#cl-01">opening bracket (cl-01)</a> is moved to the second line, and <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-expansion">line adjustment by inter-character space expansion</a> is applied. That means that space is inserted in the first line at places where it is allowed.</p>
