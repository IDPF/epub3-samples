   The <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.character-size">character size</a> of ruby characters is, in principle, the half size of the base characters (see <a class="figure_ref" href="choice_of_size_for_ruby_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_9-en">Fig. 3.58</a>).

   The '<a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.one-third-ruby">one-third-ruby</a>' characters are  used on rare occasions to attach three ruby characters to one <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.full-width">full-width</a> <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.xhtml#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>. One-third-ruby for vertical layout has the dimension of the half of the base character in width and the one third in height. Those
   for horizontal writing mode have the dimension of half of the base characters in height and one third in width (see <a class="figure_ref" href="choice_of_size_for_ruby_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_10-en">Fig. 3.59</a>).

   When ruby is attached to twelve point or larger base characters (usually used for headings), the size of the ruby letter is generally smaller than half the size of the base characters, considering the proportion of the sizes
   of base characters and ruby. When all is said and done, these cases are very rare.</p><div class="figure" id="fig2_3_11-en"><div class="figure-float"><div><img alt="Examples of ruby at a size smaller than half the size of the base characters." width="269" height="218" src="../image/Images-en/img2_3_11.png"/><div class="figureCaption">Fig. 3.60: <span class="caption-body">Examples of ruby at a size smaller than half the size of the base characters.</span></div></div></div></div><table class="t_note">

     There are cases where the body size is twelve points in books designed for infants or aged people. In these cases, the
     size of ruby can be six points, exactly the half size of the base characters.

     When the size of base characters is very small (for e.g. smaller than seven points), ruby which is half the
     size, will be even more small and illegible. In such cases where the size of base characters is very small, ruby is not
     a suitable method of annotation. In those cases, consider other annotation methods such as adding the reading in parenthesis immediately
     after the base character.

     Slightly different from the question of the size of ruby, there is a question of whether or not <a class="characterClass" href="cl-11.xhtml#cl-11">small kana (cl-11)</a> characters should be used
     in ruby annotations. Because the size is so small, there was no choice of using small kana in <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.letterpress-printing">letterpress printing</a>.
     Today there are cases where small kana are used in ruby annotations, but taking legibility into consideration, these cases should be
     limited to those where accurate readings are needed, such as for proper nouns.
