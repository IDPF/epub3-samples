Therefore, ruby texts were often composed differently for the same kanji compound word in the same situation. In some cases they differed according to the person in charge of the composition. In this section, one consistent method of ruby composition is presented as "principles part two", which is established with reference to those adopted in books and other publications.</p><ol>
				<li>
			
				
				<p>As long as jukugo-ruby can fit the kanji compound word by allowing ruby characters to overhang an adjacent base character that is part of the same compound word or those characters adjacent to the compound word which are of a certain character class such as <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>, inter-character spacing between base characters in the kanji compound word and that between the kanji compound word and the adjacent characters, should not be expanded.</p>
			
			</li>
				<li>
			
				
				<p>When a base character is accompanied by three or more ruby characters, decide the positioning of the ruby characters in the following order.</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>
				
					
					<p>Let a run of ruby text for a given base character overhang either or both of the adjacent base characters up to a maximum of one em in the ruby character size. The first choice should be the succeeding base character. For example, suppose we have a kanji compound word consisting of three ideographic characters, each of which is accompanied by three, two and one ruby characters respectively. In this case, let the third character for the first base character overhang the second base character, by letting the second ruby character for the second base character overhang the third base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-2-en">Fig. F.2</a>). In cases where there is no possible arrangement of ruby characters that follows the first choice, let them overhang the preceding base characters as in the following illustrations. <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-3-en">Fig. F.3</a> shows examples where the succeeding base characters overhang, while <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-4-en">Fig. F.4</a> are examples where the preceding base characters overhang since there is no arrangement of ruby characters to take the succeeding ones.</p>

					<p>When there is no possible arrangement of ruby characters even by allowing them to overhang the base characters participating to the same kanji compound word, at maximum by one em in ruby character size, then look at the adjacent characters in the main text surrounding the kanji compound word if they are of such character classes which ruby characters are allowed to overhang as in <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>. If they are, allow ruby characters to overhang these characters. The same principle applies here as to the choice of the adjacent (base or non-base) character to be the succeeding one in priority. For example, suppose we have a kanji compound word consisting of two ideographic characters, each of which is accompanied by three and two ruby characters respectively. In this case, let the third ruby character for the first base character overhang the second base character, by letting the second ruby character for the second base character overhang the succeeding non-base character of <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> class or the like (see <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-5-en">Fig. F.5</a>). The following are some examples. <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-6-en">Fig. F.6</a> shows examples of ruby characters that overhang the succeeding non-base characters and <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-7-en">Fig. F.7</a> are examples of ruby characters that overhang the preceding non-base characters since there is no possible arrangement to allow ruby characters to take the succeeding ones. The last illustration shows examples of ruby characters that overhang both of the non-base characters adjacent to the kanji compound word (see <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-8-en">Fig. F.8</a>).</p>

					<p>If the succeeding character in the main text adjacent to the kanji compound word accompanied by ruby characters is of a character class which does not allow ruby to overhang, as with <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.xhtml#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a>, then look at the preceding character and allow ruby to overhang the character if it is of a character class that allows it. If the examples shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-5-en">Fig. F.5</a> or <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-6-en">Fig. F.6</a> had <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.xhtml#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a> next to the kanji compound word accompanied by ruby characters, let ruby characters  overhang the preceding character in all cases but two examples with "居候" and "古代紫" (see <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2.xhtml#fig_a6-9-en">Fig. F.9</a>).</p>

					<p>When both of the preceding and succeeding characters adjacent to the kanji compound word accompanied by ruby characters are of character classes which do not allow ruby to overhang, or there are too many ruby characters and it is impossible to fit them in using the approaches described above, the last thing to consider is to fit them in by expanding the inter-character spacing of the kanji compound word. There could be various methods, depending on what priorities are chosen, and in fact many different ways have been adopted. The following section will explain one of these methods.</p>
				
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			</ol><p>To sum up the aforementioned, first try to let ruby characters overhang other base characters associated with the same kanji compound word, then look for adjacent non-base characters to see if they allow ruby to overhang. Finally when both approaches still cannot settle the positioning of the ruby characters, combine the method of expanding inter-character spacing of the compound word with the previous two.</p></body></html>
