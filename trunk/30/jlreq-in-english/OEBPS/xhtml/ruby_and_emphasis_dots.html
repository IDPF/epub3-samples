								<p>Societal change in the use of kanji  when composing Japanese and changes in the use of ruby implementations in text layout methods
     have been affecting the usage of ruby itself. Ruby was not very popular while the Touyou Kanji Table  (当用漢字表) (the list of kanji characters for everyday use, issued by the
     Government on November 16, 1946) was in effect because, in principle, it discouraged the use of furigana in its 'directions     for use' section. The <a class="termref" href="terminology.html#term.jouyou-kanji-table">Jouyou Kanji Table</a> (常用漢字表) (the list of kanji characters in common use, issued by the Government to replace the <a class="termref" href="terminology.html#term.touyou-kanji-table">Touyou Kanji Table</a> on October
     10, 1981) has changed the scope of the list. (The Touyou Kanji Table defined the list of all kanji characters that can be used for
     any documents, while the Jouyou Kanji Table was designed to be a 'reference guide' for the use of kanji to compose contemporary
     Japanese for general use in society.)
     For example, the preface of the Jouyou Kanji Table states that one may consider the use of 'furigana (annotations to indicate pronunciation)'  when the text appears too
     difficult to read. This is why the use of ruby has been increasing today. The use of ruby is common in magazines and books,
     and even newspapers have begun to use ruby these days.</p>

      Books commonly adopt kana-based jukugo-ruby for ideographic <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.html#term.compound-word">compound words</a>. However, due to technical difficulties for rendering jukugo-ruby in machine-assisted text layout, the adoption of kana-based mono-ruby is increasing. For example, newspapers do not use jukugo-ruby, and study aids generally use mono-ruby because it is considered more important to show the readings of each <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.html#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> for students than to be concerned about the beauty of the layout.</p>

      Multiple ideographic  <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.html#term.compound-word">compound words</a> can form one compound phrase. In this case, there are two ways to attach ruby, i.e. attaching ruby
      to the compound phrase as a whole, or to each word which forms the compound (see <a class="figure_ref" href="ruby_and_emphasis_dots.html#fig2_3_5-en">Fig. 3.53</a>). Similarly, a Japanese personal name consists of a given name and a family name, which together form a compound of a full
      name, and it is an editorial decision whether to attach two runs of ruby, one each for given name and family name, or to attach the
      full ruby text to the compound which represents the reading of the full name.

      In most cases, the reading of a ideographic compound word  is just a concatenation of the readings of each individual <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.html#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>, but some phrases

      ruby to those phrases, which are usually sequences of two or three <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.html#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a>, is essentially the same as attaching ruby in <a class="characterClass" href="cl-16.html#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> to <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.html#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> and/or <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.html#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> base characters  (see <a class="figure_ref" href="ruby_and_emphasis_dots.html#fig2_3_6_2-en">Fig. 3.55</a>).</p>

    <p>PURPOSE: Ruby annotation that annotates a

<a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.html#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.html#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>
word with

<a class="characterClass" href="cl-16.html#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a>
to provide its meaning, together with it's reading. In terms of ruby layout, attaching ruby text to a single character in

<a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.html#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>
is essentially the same as attaching the reading to a

<a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.html#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>
(e.g. attaching ruby text "バザール", 'Bazaar', in

<a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.html#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="cl-16.html#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a>
to a

<a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.html#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>
"市" is just like attaching the reading "いち" to that character). When attaching
<a class="characterClass" href="cl-16.html#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a>
ruby text to a run of base text consisting of two or more characters in

<a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.html#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> and/or <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.html#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>, the ruby text needs to be positioned as if it corresponds to the annotated text itself, no matter how the ruby characters are distributed across each base character. The most typical example of this is attaching ruby text to a kanji compound word to indicate a corresponding loan word in katakana (see <a class="figure_ref" href="ruby_and_emphasis_dots.html#fig2_3_6_2-en">Fig. 3.55</a>). The use of ruby text of this kind is on the increase in proportion to the growing need for translations and loan words. This type of ruby, namely ruby letters that are attached to two or more base characters as one object (note that ruby characters are not limited to <a class="characterClass" href="cl-16.html#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a>. <a class="figure_ref" href="ruby_and_emphasis_dots.html#fig2_3_6-en">Fig. 3.54</a> and <a class="figure_ref" href="ruby_and_emphasis_dots.html#fig2_3_7-en">Fig. 3.56</a>), is called <a class="termref" href="terminology.html#term.group-ruby">group-ruby</a>. Group-ruby and it's base characters are unbreakable, because of their behavior as one object (it is possible to break a line in the middle of the base characters where <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.html#term.jukugo-ruby">jukugo-ruby</a>
is in use).</p>

is longer than the corresponding base text, the base text is, in general, stretched by adding inter-character spaces between base characters, so that the ruby and base text look similar in length (see <a class="figure_ref" href="ruby_and_emphasis_dots.html#fig2_3_6_2-en">Fig. 3.55</a>). On the other hand, when the base text or ruby text is Latin word, the word is set with western solid setting, and no inter-character space will be added to any ruby or base text in Latin characters no matter how different the ruby and base text look in length (see <a class="figure_ref" href="ruby_and_emphasis_dots.html#fig2_3_7-en">Fig. 3.56</a>). Details will be explained later.</p>
