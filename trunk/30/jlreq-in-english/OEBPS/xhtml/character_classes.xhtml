                     <p>General <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.punctuation-marks">punctuation marks</a> are script neutral in ISO/IEC 10646
                        and there is no "Opening Ideographic Parenthesis" specifically
                        encoded for CJK scripts in the standard. However, because of the
                        typographic difference among scripts with respect to <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.base-line">base line</a>
                        position as well as width and glyph design, the same set of
                        punctuation marks usually do not fit to both Latin and Japanese
                        text. To work around this issue, many existing implementations use
                        compatibility characters encoded separately in the standard
                        for the purpose of round-trip integrity with the legacy
                        encoding standards. For example, while this document lists
                        U+0028 LEFT PARENTHESIS as a member of <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.xhtml#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>,
                        the compatibility counterpart U+FF08 FULLWIDTH LEFT PARENTHESIS
                        is used in the Japanese context in most Japanese text layout
                        software.</p>
