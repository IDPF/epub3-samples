				</table><p>Sometimes the space between paragraphs is specified. JIS X 4051 determines the space before the paragraph as "space before paragraph"  and the space after the paragraph as "space after paragraph". When the "space before paragraph" or the "space after paragraph" is specified,  the space will be kept between paragraphs. Thus "space before paragraph" or "space after paragraph" in the JIS X 4051 context is usually specified with absolute space sizes (see <a class="figure_ref" href="processing_of_spaces_between_paragraphs.xhtml#fig3_5_5-en">Fig. 4.121</a>)  or a number of lines (see <a class="figure_ref" href="processing_of_spaces_between_paragraphs.xhtml#fig3_5_5_2-en">Fig. 4.122</a>).
