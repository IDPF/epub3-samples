					<li>
				
					
					<p>The line gap of parallel-notes is basically a half em of the character size of the parallel-notes. When the volume of parallel-notes is high, there are cases of one third em.</p>

								<p>The size of the main text in the kihon-hanmen in the block direction is calculated with character size, number of lines and line gap. The block direction size of the parallel-note area is the same with regards to the result of the calculation. Accordingly, the block direction size of the parallel-note area might be different from the result of following calculation: (character size of parallel-note) × (number of lines of parallel-note + line gap of note × (number of lines of parallel-note − 1).</p>

					<p>Usually, indentation of the second line and after, like end notes,  is not applied to parallel-notes. In the majority of cases, the first line of a parallel-note is set as tentsuki.

This arrangement is done until the first parallel-note reaches  the right edge in vertical writing mode or  the top edge in horizontal writing mode.
