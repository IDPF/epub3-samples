				<li>
			
				
				<p>Because the purpose of ruby annotation, including jukugo-ruby, is to supply the reading of each base kanji character, attach each run of ruby text which represents the reading to the corresponding base kanji character.</p>
			
			
				
				<p>If each run of ruby characters representing the reading of a given base <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.xhtml#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> participating in a kanji compound word is less than or equal to two, attach each ruby text to the corresponding base <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.xhtml#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> (see <a class="figure_ref" href="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_1.xhtml#fig_a6-1-en">Fig. F.1</a>). The following figures supply a pair of examples of the same text per line, with and without character frames displayed. Ruby characters and base characters in the same color indicate that they correspond to each other. Those <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.xhtml#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a> which are not part of the jukugo-ruby, and which, therefore, ruby characters are not allowed to overhang, are presented in yet different colors. </p>

			</li>
				<li>
			
				
				<p>Because the intention when using jukugo-ruby is to handle the kanji compound word (jukugo) as one object, a run of ruby text for a base <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.xhtml#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> is allowed to overhang the adjacent base character participating to the same compound word, up to a maximum of one em in the ruby character size (alternatively, the maximum size for the ruby overhang can be one and a half em, but the explanation hereafter assumes the maximum overhang to be one em in the ruby size.).</p>
			
			</li>
				<li>
			
				
				<p>When the number of ruby characters is so great that the length of the ruby text is longer than that of the base characters forming the kanji compound word, the decision to what extent the ruby text can overhang the adjacent characters, if allowed, shall be made according to the methods explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters.xhtml#adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters">3.3.8 Adjustments of Ruby with Length Longer than that of the Base Characters</a>. The explanation hereafter adopts one of the methods that prohibits any ruby text to overhang <a class="characterClass" href="cl-19.xhtml#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a> but allows ruby to overhang the characters of a certain character class such as <a class="characterClass" href="cl-15.xhtml#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="cl-16.xhtml#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a>, up to a maximum of one em in the ruby character size.</p>
