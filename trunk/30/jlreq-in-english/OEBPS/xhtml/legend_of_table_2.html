			<p>The  left-most column, labeled  "before", lists preceding character classes, and the top row, labeled "after", lists trailing character classes. Each cell indicates the amount of space between two characters of the corresponding character classes at the intersection of a given row and column.</p>
		
</li>
<li>
		
			
			<p>The last row, labeled "<a class="termref" href="terminology.html#term.line-head">line head</a>", lists amounts of space inserted between the line head and a character of the corresponding character class in each column. Likewise, the last column, labeled "<a class="termref" href="terminology.html#term.line-end">line end</a>", lists amounts of space inserted between a character of the corresponding character class in each row and the line end.</p>

				The reason for the distinction between the two half em spaces ("be" stands for "before" and "af" stands for "after") is necessary  because there are cases where a line is composed with different sizes of characters, as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="legend_of_table_2.html#fig_a1-1-en">Fig. B.1</a> where it is necessary to disambiguate which em size we are referring to. Likewise, other instances of the notation "be" or "af" in this appendix are for the same disambiguation.</p>

				<p>1/2 be hang: Identical to "1/2 be" in the amount of space. Ruby text can be extended up to the size of the ruby character over this "1/2 be hang" space as long as it is not reduced due to line adjustments. When it is reduced, ruby text can be extended up to the size of the reduced space and shall not be extended over the other character.</p>
			
		</li>
		<li>
			
				
				<p>1/2 af hang: Identical to "1/2 af" in the amount of space. Ruby text can be extended up to the size of the ruby character over this "1/2 af hang" space as long as it is not reduced due to line adjustments. When it is reduced, ruby text can be extended up to the size of the reduced space and shall not be extended over the other character.</p>

				<p>1/4 be: Insert a quarter em space, where the em here indicates the size of the preceding character.</p>

		<li>
			
				
				<p>1/4 af: Insert a quarter em space, where the em here indicates the size of the trailing character.</p>
			
		</li>
		<li>
			
				
				<p>1/4 be hang: Identical to "1/4 be" in the amount of space. Ruby text can be extended up to half the size of the ruby character over this "1/4 be hang" space as long as it is not reduced due to line adjustments. When it is reduced, ruby text can be extended up to the size of the reduced space and shall not be extended over the other character.</p>

				<p>1/4 af hang: Identical to "1/4 af" in the amount of space. Ruby text can be extended up to half the size of the ruby character over this "1/4 af hang" space as long as it is not reduced due to line adjustments. When it is reduced, ruby text can be extended up to the size of the reduced space and shall not be extended over the other character.</p>
			
		</li>
		<li>
			
				
				<p>ruby hang: Set solid. Ruby text can be extended up to the size of the ruby character over the other character (see also 7 of <a class="sec_ref" href="notes_a2.html#notes_a2">B.2 Notes</a>).</p>
