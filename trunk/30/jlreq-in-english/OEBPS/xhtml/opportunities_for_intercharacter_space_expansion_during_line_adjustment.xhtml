(For more detail on line adjustment, see <a class="sec_ref" href="line_adjustment.xhtml#line_adjustment">3.8 Line Adjustment</a>.) In the process of line adjustment by inter-character space expansion, the first place to look  (the first stage of inter-character space expansion in priority order) is for <a class="characterClass" href="cl-26.xhtml#cl-26">Western word spaces (cl-26)</a>, each of which is expandable equally,  to take up and maximum of a half em space with respect to the corresponding character size. The tables are for the second and subsequent stages of inter-character space expansion in priority order, assuming the first stage of the expansion for <a class="characterClass" href="cl-26.xhtml#cl-26">Western word spaces (cl-26)</a> is already done. The default unadjusted space between two adjacent characters of given character classes shall be determined according to <a class="sec_ref" href="spacing_between_characters.xhtml#spacing_between_characters">Appendix B Spacing between Characters</a>.</p><div class="table-pdf" id="table7_pdf">
