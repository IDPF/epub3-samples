characters for Japanese composition have basically been designed to have a square
character frame from the letterpress printing era on. Thus the same collection of <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.printing-types">printing types</a>
can be used in either vertical writing mode or horizontal writing mode, simply by changing the direction of text, (see <a class="figure_ref" href="vertical_writing_mode_and_horizontal_writing_mode.xhtml#fig1_13-en">Fig. 2.18</a>). There were some attempts to develop <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.printing-types">printing types</a>
designed exclusively for horizontal writing mode, but they were not widely accepted.</p>

								<p>For official (e.g. governmental) documentation, horizontal writing mode is recommended. Educational material (with the exception
 of certain topics) is mostly in horizontal writing mode. Readers of "mobile novels" are increasing, and it
 is expected that in the future horizontal writing mode will increase in this area as well. However, most of the large newspapers
 are written completely in vertical writing mode, and most of the large journals for ordinary readers are almost completely set in vertical writing mode. In addition, novels, which are the most widely read kind of book publication, are almost completely in vertical writing mode
 (some readers say that they cannot read a novel if it is not in vertical writing mode). Hence it can be expected that the importance
 of vertical writing mode for Japanese will not change for the time being.</p>
