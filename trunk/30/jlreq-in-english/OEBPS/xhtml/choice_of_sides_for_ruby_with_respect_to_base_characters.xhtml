   In principle, ruby is attached to the right of base characters in vertical writing mode, and above in horizontal writing mode.
</p><p>
   In some special cases, ruby can be seen to the left of base characters in vertical writing mode, and below in horizontal writing mode, but this is very rare.
</p><p>
   There are cases where two kinds of ruby are attached, one to either side of the base characters, one for readings and the other for
   meanings (see <a class="figure_ref" href="choice_of_sides_for_ruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_12-en">Fig. 3.61</a>). This is also very rare.

   In the following sections, the ruby composition methods will be explained on the assumption that the size of ruby is half the size of the
   base characters, and they will be attached to the right in vertical writing mode and above in horizontal writing mode. First we look at
   the basic composition rules of <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.mono-ruby">mono-ruby</a>, <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.group-ruby">group-ruby</a> and <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.jukugo-ruby">jukugo-ruby</a>, then the rules of positioning of ruby with respect to
   those characters which come before and after the base characters, and finally the composition rules at the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.line-head">line head</a>
   and at the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.line-end">line end</a>.
