                                   <p>The notations of OMOTEKEI, URAKEI and CHUUBOSOKEI are inherited from the letterpress printing age, and have been used in computerized type setting. The physical shape of the border in letterpress printing is shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="an_example_of_layout_with_a_table.html#fig3_4_7-en">Fig. 4.106</a>. OMOTEKEI is printed with the sharp edge  and URAKEI is printed with bottom flat edge. The width of the top edge of CHUUBOSOKEI is cast between the top edge of OMOTEKEI and the bottom edge of OMOTEKEI, so CHUUBOSOKEI can be used as URAKEI when the bottom edge is used. Furthermore, in letterpress printing, the width of OMOTEKEI, CHUUBOSOKEI and URAKEI are different but the width of  the bottom of the borders is the same as each other. However, there are two kinds of bottom of border, one is 1/8 of one point, the other is 1/8 of one GOU (i.e. 10.5 points), namely 1.3 point. When the GOU-KEISEN (5 border) is used, the URAKEI is  thicker than the POINT-KEISEN.</p>

Accordingly, by this description KEISEN is treated as if the width of KEISEN is zero. OMOTEKEI can be regarded as zero width, however,  the width of URAKEI should be considered, and cell padding is measured from the edge of the KEISEN. In this document, the cell padding is measured from the edge of KEISEN. However,  for OMOTEKEI, the difference between the center of KEISEN and the edge of KEISEN can be ignored. </p>

The spaces between invisible KEISEN and cell content are a fourth em space of the basic table character size. Namely, it can be said that the visible line gaps are one half em except for the header row. In this example, there are two line cells as a header, the block direction spaces between KEISEN and cell contents are set with a minimum gap of one fourth em (see <a class="figure_ref" href="an_example_of_layout_with_a_table.html#fig3_4_6-en">Fig. 4.105</a> a and b).

                                   <p>It is basically recommended that the spaces between visible KEISEN and cell content should be a half em and between invisible KEISEN and cell content should be a quarter em from an aesthetic view point. However, when the table is large enough to occupy one full page, it might seem that the half em space sizes are too large. In such cases, the space sizes  may be reduced to a quarter em, and  exceptional spaces may be set  every five or ten lines. </p>
