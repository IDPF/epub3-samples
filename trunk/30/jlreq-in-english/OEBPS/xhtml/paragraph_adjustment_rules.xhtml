    <p>Line head indent at the beginning of paragraphs is applied to all paragraphs. Nearly all books and magazines make use of
    this method (see <a class="figure_ref" href="paragraph_adjustment_rules.xhtml#fig2_5_1-en">Fig. 3.94</a>).

Hence, there is no line head indent at
   the beginning of the "she said" phrase, after the conversation part, i.e. so-called tentsuki (see <a class="figure_ref" href="paragraph_adjustment_rules.xhtml#fig2_5_2-en">Fig. 3.95</a>). When you have a (mathematical) formula on a separate line in <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.horizontal-writing-mode">horizontal writing mode</a>, and a following line containing text such as "will be" there is also no line head indent at the beginning of the paragraph. On the other hand, there is also an approach in novels etc., where the first line indent is applied to paragraphs (see <a class="figure_ref" href="paragraph_adjustment_rules.xhtml#fig2_5_3-en">Fig. 3.96</a>).</p>

    <p>Line head indent at the beginning of paragraphs is not applied for any paragraph at all, and the tentsuki position is used
    (see <a class="figure_ref" href="paragraph_adjustment_rules.xhtml#fig2_5_4-en">Fig. 3.97</a>). There are examples of this method being used in certain books and magazines for the sake of styling, but this is rather hard
