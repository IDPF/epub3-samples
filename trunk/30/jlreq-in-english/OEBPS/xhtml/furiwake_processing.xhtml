Furiwake is also used to indicate
            options (see <a class="figure_ref" href="furiwake_processing.xhtml#fig2_7_2-en">Fig. 3.115</a>). Study guides, manuals and reference books sometimes use furiwake. In many furiwake styles, multiple lines are indicated with
 <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.xhtml#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="cl-02.xhtml#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>, etc.</p><div class="figure" id="fig2_7_2-en"><div class="figure-float"><div><img alt="Example of furiwake." width="167" height="438" src="../image/Images-en/img2_7_2.png"/><div class="figureCaption">Fig. 3.115: <span class="caption-body">Example of furiwake.</span></div></div></div></div><p>Furiwake is usually done as follows (see <a class="figure_ref" href="furiwake_processing.xhtml#fig2_7_3-en">Fig. 3.116</a>). In this document, the lines which combine to make the furiwake are called furiwake-gyou.</p><ol>
					<li>
					<p>The character size of the furiwake-gyou is usually the same as that of the base paragraph. Sometimes, the furiwake-gyou
               is a little bit smaller than the size of the base paragraph. Sometimes, the font style of the furiwake-gyou is different <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.typeface">typeface</a> the
               style of the base paragraph.</p></li>
					<li>
					<p>In the same furiwake block, the top positions of all the furiwake-gyou lines are aligned.</p></li>
					<li>
					<p>The line length of the furiwake block is the line length of the longest furiwake-gyou. However, it is permitted to indicate
               the length of the furiwake block, and break the furiwake-gyou lines. In this style, the start positions of the broken lines should be
               explicitly indicated. When there are line break marks in the furiwake-gyou, the line is broken in the indicated places. In this style,
               the start positions of the wrapped lines are aligned to the first line. The space between wrapped lines should be set solid.</p></li>
					<li>
					<p>The line-feed space of each furiwake block should be explicitly indicated.</p></li>
					<li>
					<p>The center line of the furiwake block should be aligned with the center line of the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.main-text">main text</a>.</p></li>
					<li>
					<p>When the furiwake block is enclosed by <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.xhtml#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="cl-02.xhtml#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>, etc. the width of brackets should be the same as
 the width of the furiwake block.</p></li>
					<li>
					<p>One furiwake block should be set per base text line. One furiwake block should not be extended across multiple base text lines.</p></li>

The space should be decided by considering the content of the furiwake block, and may therefore differ from the size of the line-feed space  of kihon-hanmen.</p><p>In general, the width of the furiwake block is larger than the width of an inline cutting note block. However, unlike in the case of the inline cutting block, the whole furiwake block should
            be set inside of the kihon-hanmen, or a <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.column">column</a> of the kihon-hanmen Setting a furiwake block that extends beyond the border of the kihon-hanmen
