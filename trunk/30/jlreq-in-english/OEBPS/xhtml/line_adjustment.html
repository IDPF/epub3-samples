Within a paragraph, lines are created by separating character sequences at places where line breaking is not prohibited. Except for the end
of the last line of a paragraph, it is necessary to set the head
and end
of each line at predicable,
aligned positions. For the last line of the paragraph, it is still necessary to set the head at the aligned position, however the line end  need not aligned to the other alignment position. To achieve this, only inter-character spacing indicated in the table of <a class="sec_ref" href="spacing_between_characters.html#spacing_between_characters">Appendix B Spacing between Characters</a>, or explicitly chosen  space sizes, are inserted, and other inter-character spaces are set solid.

								<p>In Japanese composition, there is no concept corresponding to the Western "ragged right (flush left)", "ragged left (flush right)", or "ragged center". In Japanese composition, especially common book composition, usually only "justification" is applied. Note that, in Western composition, "justification" is usually applied for only word space sizes. In Japanese composition, it is applied for not only <a class="characterClass" href="cl-26.html#cl-26">Western word space (cl-26)</a>
but also in several other places as explained in following text.</p>

reduction is applied for <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.html#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="cl-02.html#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>

								<p>There is another adjustment processing, besides line adjustment, called "single line alignment". Single line alignment is applied to align a run of the text that is shorter than a given line length to designated positions. Details are explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="single_line_alignment_processing.html#single_line_alignment_processing">3.5.3 Single Line Alignment Processing</a>.</p>

				</table><p>There are various reasons for line adjustment processing. Examples of the most important ones will be given below.</p><ol>
					<li>
              <p>Mixed use of characters and symbols (e.g. <a class="characterClass" href="cl-24.html#cl-24">grouped numerals (cl-24)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="cl-27.html#cl-27">Western characters (cl-27)</a>) where not all characters are full-width
               (see <a class="figure_ref" href="line_adjustment.html#fig2_51-en">Fig. 3.124</a>).

					<li>
					<p>Sequences of <a class="termref" href="terminology.html#term.punctuation-marks">punctuation marks</a>. For example, a sequence of a <a class="characterClass" href="cl-02.html#cl-02">closing bracket (cl-02)</a>
and a <a class="characterClass" href="cl-06.html#cl-06">full stop (cl-06)</a>
takes one and a half em spaces together (see <a class="figure_ref" href="line_adjustment.html#fig2_52-en">Fig. 3.125</a>). However, if an <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.html#cl-01">opening bracket (cl-01)</a>
follows immediately after the full stop, these punctuation marks will need two em size spaces together. Hence, no adjustment is needed to correctly align the line end (see <a class="figure_ref" href="line_adjustment.html#fig2_52-en">Fig. 3.125</a>).</p>

					<p>Mixtures of characters with different sizes (see <a class="figure_ref" href="line_adjustment.html#fig2_53-en">Fig. 3.126</a>).</p>
