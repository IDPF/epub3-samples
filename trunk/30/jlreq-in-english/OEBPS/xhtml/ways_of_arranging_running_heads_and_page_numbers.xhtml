 <p>In the double running head method, a higher-level title, such as that of the chapter or book, is used for the running heads on the even pages, and a lower-level title, such as that for a section, on the odd pages. Where there are no differing levels of titles, such as on the page containing the table of contents, the same <a class="termref2nd" href="terminology.xhtml#term.running-head">running head</a> is used on both even and odd pages.</p>

 <p>Which information is used for the running heads depends on the content of the book. Given that the main purpose
 of running heads is to signpost to readers what is written on each page, or the content of the current page, it does not
 make much sense to use the book title for the running head. The most common approach for a book with three levels of headings, such as chapter, section and subsection, is to use the highest  level heading (i.e. chapter) and the second level heading (i.e. section).</p>

 <p>In the single running head method, one of the headings between the top and third levels is used.</p>
 
 </li>
					<li>
 
 
 <p>In principle, the contents of running heads will be the same as those of headings with the following differences:</p>
 
 <ol>
 <li>
 
 
 <p>Numbers and words in Latin alphanumeric characters in vertically set headings in vertically set books should be changed to horizontal notation for horizontally set running heads (see <a class="sec_ref" href="major_differences_between_vertical_writing_mode_and_horizontal_writing_mode.xhtml#major_differences_between_vertical_writing_mode_and_horizontal_writing_mode">2.3.2 Major Differences between Vertical Writing Mode and Horizontal Writing Mode</a>).</p>
 
 </li>
 <li>
 
 
 <p>If headings are too long, they should be made shorter by paraphrasing them in fewer characters. Running heads with too many characters
 will not look good.
</p>
 
 </li>
 <li>
 
 
 <p>For certain publications, such as a collection of monographs, the names of authors may be added in parentheses at the end of the running head.</p>

 <p>In principle, the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.text-direction">text direction</a> of running heads and page numbers should be the same as that of the kihon-hanmen. For vertically set books,  however, it is more common to set running heads and page numbers horizontally.</p>

 <p>There are two types of page numbering. "<a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.continuous-pagination">Continuous pagination</a>" means that page numbers continue throughout the whole book.
 "<a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.independent-pagination">Independent pagination</a>" means that page numbers start from "1" separately at beginning of the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.front-matter">front matter</a> and <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.back-matter">back matter</a>. There is also,
 for example in manuals, the method of starting each chapter from page number "1". (In such cases, it is
 common that the name of the chapter is added as a prefix before the page number.)</p>

 <p>For vertically set books  with indexes in horizontal writing mode, the following methods are available.</p>
 
 <ol>
 <li>
 
 
 <p>Reverse pagination. The index reads from the end of the book, and page numbers are added starting with "1" from the end of the book and flow in the same order as the index.</p>
 
 </li>
 <li>
 
 
 <p>Continuous pagination. The index reads from the end of the book, but page numbers start with "1" and flow in the same order as the book.
 (The index pages flow in the reverse order to the page numbers.)</p>
 
 </li>
 <li>
 
 
 <p>Both reverse pagination
and continuous pagination. In this case, the page numbers for continuous pagination are in the same position as the page numbers of the main text, and page numbers in reverse pagination are in a different position (for example, if serial pagination is in the foot of the page, reverse pagination is in the head). Often other methods are applied to distinguish the different paginations. For example,  Arabic numbers are used for both continuous pagination and reverse pagination, but for reverse pagination, brackets are added around the numbers.</p>
