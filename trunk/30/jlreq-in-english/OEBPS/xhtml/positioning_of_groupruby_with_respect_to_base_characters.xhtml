   When the length of a sequence of base characters (number of characters * advance-width of each character) and that
   of the ruby text are the same, each text is set solid and the center of both texts are aligned with each other (see
   <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_groupruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_18-en">Fig. 3.67</a>).

To be more specific, where 2 units of inter-character space are used between ruby characters, add 1 unit of space between the start of  the base text and the start of the ruby text, and between the end of the ruby text and the end of the base text. This  will give a balanced appearance, and is the method specified in JIS X 4051 (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_groupruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_19-en">Fig. 3.68</a>). Another way is to first align the leading characters for both the base text and ruby text and the ends of both trailing characters, and then add the same amount of inter-character space between the rest of the ruby characters (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_groupruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_20-en">Fig. 3.69</a>).</p><div class="figure" id="fig2_3_19-en"><div class="figure-float"><div><img alt="Example 1 of distribution of group-ruby alongside base characters where the length of the ruby is shorter than that of the base characters." width="591" height="221" src="../image/Images-en/img2_3_19.png"/><div class="figureCaption">Fig. 3.68: <span class="caption-body">Example 1 of distribution of group-ruby alongside base characters where the length of the ruby is shorter than that of the base characters.</span></div></div></div></div><div class="figure" id="fig2_3_20-en"><div class="figure-float"><div><img alt="Example 2 of distribution of group-ruby alongside base characters where the length of the ruby is shorter than that of the base characters." width="280" height="193" src="../image/Images-en/img2_3_20.png"/><div class="figureCaption">Fig. 3.69: <span class="caption-body">Example 2 of distribution of group-ruby alongside base characters where the length of the ruby is shorter than that of the base characters.</span></div></div></div></div><table class="t_note">

     In letterpress printing, there were not many choices for adjustment of inter-character space between ruby characters. Therefore,
     depending on the number of characters in the base text and its ruby text, the choice was whether to add a certain amount of space
     before the leading ruby character and after the trailing character, or not. In the former case it had been said that for 2
     units of inter-character space between each c ruby characters, adding 1 unit of the leading and trailing space would
     give a balanced appearance.

     When the length of the ruby text is far shorter than that of the base text, the method specified in JIS X 4051 could
     result in space twice the size of a ruby character for the leading and the trailing space, which might give a misleading appearance.
     Therefore, a criterion for deciding whether or not to adopt the method of JIS X 4051 is to see if the amount of the leading and the trailing
     space exceeds the full-width size (or up to 1.5 times the size) of a ruby character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="positioning_of_groupruby_with_respect_to_base_characters.xhtml#fig2_3_21-en">Fig. 3.70</a>).
