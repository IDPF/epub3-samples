Usually, around six point size is used (see <a class="figure_ref" href="inline_cutting_note.xhtml#fig2_4_1-en">Fig. 3.89</a>).</p><p>The space between adjacent lines in an inline cutting note is zero, that is to say, there is no <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.line-gap">line gap</a> between them (see <a class="figure_ref" href="character_size_for_inline_cutting_notes_and_line_gaps.xhtml#fig2_4_2-en">Fig. 3.90</a>).</p><p>As shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="character_size_for_inline_cutting_notes_and_line_gaps.xhtml#fig2_4_2-en">Fig. 3.90</a>, an inline cutting note usually has two lines, and is surrounded by <span class="character">LEFT PARENTHESIS "("</span> and <span class="character">RIGHT PARENTHESIS ")"</span> characters that are double the size of the characters in the inline cutting note itself.

are also used in inline cutting note text. In such cases, the handling of such symbols is the same as for the <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.main-text">main text</a>.</p><p>In vertical text, the horizontal width of the inline cutting note area is wider than the width of a <a class="termref" href="terminology.xhtml#term.kihon-hanmen">kihon-hanmen</a> line. The horizontal centers of the kihon-hanmen line and inline cutting note area are aligned. The line gap used to establish the kihon-hanmen should not be affected by the horizontal
   width of the inline cutting note area.
   In other words, the line gap for the kihon-hanmen needs to be designed wider than usual in preparation for the use of the  inline cutting note. (see <a class="figure_ref" href="considerations_in_designing_the_kihonhanmen.xhtml#fig_ad1_18-en">Fig. 2.35</a> and <a class="figure_ref" href="inline_cutting_note.xhtml#fig2_4_1-en">Fig. 3.89</a>) Warichu is used also in horizontal text, however it is not so common, and usually occurs only in study guides and encyclopedias.</p><p>The length of the two lines of the inline cutting note should be as near as possible the same. When the inline cutting note can be set in one kihon-hanmen line, the whole inline note text should be broken at a position where line breaking is permitted, and where the two resulting lines are as close as possible to the same length. The length of the second line should not be longer than the length of the first line. Note that the same line breaking rules are used as for basic text  (see <a class="figure_ref" href="character_size_for_inline_cutting_notes_and_line_gaps.xhtml#fig2_4_3-en">Fig. 3.91</a>).</p><div class="figure" id="fig2_4_3-en"><div class="figure-float"><div><img alt="Examples showing how the inline cutting note can be set in one line of base text." width="140" height="312" src="../image/Images-en/img2_4_3.png"/><div class="figureCaption">Fig. 3.91: <span class="caption-body">Examples showing how the inline cutting note can be set in one line of base text.</span></div></div></div></div></body></html>
