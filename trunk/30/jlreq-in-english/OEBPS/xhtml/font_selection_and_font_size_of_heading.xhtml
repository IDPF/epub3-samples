So, each level of heading has to have an appropriate visual style. The following issues have to be considered:</p><ol>
					<li>
                        
                           
                           <p>Character size for the heading</p>
                        
                                 
                                    
                                    <p>The character size of headings should be selected as appropriate in accordance with the level of headings. For example, when the character size of main text is 9 point, the small-headings are usually set with 10 points, medium-headings are usually set with 12 points and large-headings are usually set with 14 points. The character size of headings is usually larger than main text, and the character size of higher level headings are larger than the size of smaller size headings. <a class="figure_ref" href="font_selection_and_font_size_of_heading.xhtml#fig3_1_7-en">Fig. 4.7</a>
is an example of this principle.</p>

Accordingly, so that the main text is set solid, the indent value of a heading is recommended to be an integral multiplication of the main character size (see <a class="figure_ref" href="font_selection_and_font_size_of_heading.xhtml#fig3_1_9-en">Fig. 4.9</a>).</p>
