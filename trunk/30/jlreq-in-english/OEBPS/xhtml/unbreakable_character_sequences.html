     <p>It is possible to have a line break between ideographic numerals. Also it is possible to have a line break after <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA "、"</span>
used as a decimal separator or an indicator for approximate number, and <span class="character">KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT "・"</span>
as a decimal point. However, the position between ideographic numerals and <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA "、"</span>
used as a decimal separator or an indicator for approximate number, and <span class="character">KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT "・"</span>
used as a decimal point is unbreakable. The reason is that the natural usage of ideographic numerals is to write them like "二百三十五", that is with inserted rank indicators (Explanation: "二" means "two", "百" means "hundred". "二百" means "two hundred". "三" means "three", "十" means "ten". "三十" means "thirty"."五" means "five". The complete sequence "二百三十五" means "Two hundred and thirty five".). Hence, it is not necessary to express rank via position. In contrast, line breaks are forbidden for European numerals, since it is necessary to express the rank via the position. Furthermore, if in vertical writing mode European numerals are placed in an upright position like ordinary Japanese characters, they are used like the ideographic numerals, and it is possible to have a line break between them.</p>
