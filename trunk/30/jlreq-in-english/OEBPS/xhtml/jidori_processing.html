In such cases, different numbers of characters are set, using adjustment of the inter-character spacing, so that they are all aligned to the same length. This is called <a class="termref" href="terminology.html#term.jidori">jidori</a> processing
            (see <a class="figure_ref" href="jidori_processing.html#fig2_7_4-en">Fig. 3.117</a>).</p><div class="figure" id="fig2_7_4-en"><div class="figure-float"><div><img alt="Example 1 of jidori processing." width="254" height="314" src="../image/Images-en/img2_7_4.png"/><div class="figureCaption">Fig. 3.117: <span class="caption-body">Example 1 of jidori processing.</span></div></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, in <a class="termref" href="terminology.html#term.horizontal-writing-mode">horizontal writing mode</a>, text in <a class="termref" href="terminology.html#term.running-head">running heads</a> (with the exception of chapter and section numbers) are set using jidori processing. For example, three to six characters are set in a 7 character space (based on the size of the characters in the running head (see <a class="figure_ref" href="jidori_processing.html#fig2_7_5-en">Fig. 3.118</a>). Two characters are set in a 6 character space to avoid too much space. Seven characters are set solid in a seven character space, and eight or more characters are set solid in a space of eight or more characters. This rule can be applied to other numbers of characters, such as five, six and eight.</p><div class="figure" id="fig2_7_5-en"><div class="figure-float"><div><img alt="Example 2 of jidori processing." width="432" height="377" src="../image/Images-en/img2_7_5.png"/><div class="figureCaption">Fig. 3.118: <span class="caption-body">Example 2 of jidori processing.</span></div></div></div></div><p>Jidori processing should be done as follows:</p><ol>
					<li>
					<p>The length for the jidori processing should be defined as a whole number of full-width characters at the size defined for the surrounding text.</p></li>
					<li>
					<p>The jidori text should be adjusted using spacing between characters so that the sides of the text are aligned at the defined length. The following, however, should be set solid:</p><ol><li>
               
               <p>Positions where line breaks are prohibited: inter-character spaces between European numerals; between two <span class="character">EM DASH "—"</span> characters; between two <span class="character">TWO DOT LEADER "‥"</span> characters; between two <span class="character">HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS "…"</span> characters; and so on. These sequences should be treated as a single block.</p>

<p>The handling of <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.html#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="cl-02.html#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> in jidori processing is also very controversial. Usually, the space before
 <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.html#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and space after <a class="characterClass" href="cl-02.html#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> is set solid. In jidori processing, the space before <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.html#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and the space after <a class="characterClass" href="cl-02.html#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> may be used for line adjustment, but the space after <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.html#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>
 and the space before <a class="characterClass" href="cl-02.html#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> should not used for adjustment, because it is prohibited to break lines in these positions.           <a class="figure_ref" href="jidori_processing.html#fig2_7_52-en">Fig. 3.119</a> shows one example with even spacing for all characters, a second example as explained here, and a third example that is set solid before and after the <a class="characterClass" href="cl-01.html#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="cl-02.html#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>.</p></td></tr></table>
