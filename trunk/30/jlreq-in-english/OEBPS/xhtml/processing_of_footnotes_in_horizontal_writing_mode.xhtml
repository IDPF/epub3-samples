								<p>When some part of a footnote overflows to the next page or the next column, it is recommended to set an arrow symbol or similar symbol at the very end of the part of the footnote set in the page or the column where the corresponding reference mark appears, to indicate that the footnote is continuing to the next page or the next column. Especially, when the overflowed part of the footnote is set in an even page, such guidance is very useful. To put it the other way around, it is better to avoid such cases. Treating such cases is not a matter of type setting methodology but  of editorial issues. One editorial solution is to change the position of the reference mark by modification of the page layout. </p>
