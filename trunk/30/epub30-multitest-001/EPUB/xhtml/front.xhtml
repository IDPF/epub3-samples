        <h1>EPUB 3.0 Compliance Test Suite: Document 01 <br /> [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]</h1>

        <p>This is one of the documents in the EPUB3 Compliance test suite.</p>

        <p>This particular document focuses on human-evaluated binary (pass/fail) tests in a
            reflowable context. Tests for fixed-layout content and other individual tests that
            require a dedicated epub file are available in additional sibling documents.</p>

        <p>The following conventions are used throughout the document:</p>
        <dl class="info">
            <dt>1. Locating a test</dt>
            <dd>
                <div class="ctest">
                    <p>Tests that pertain to <em>required</em> Reading System functionality are
                        preceded by a "locator box" that looks like this: <span class="test-id"
                            >Test-001</span></p>
                </div>
                <div class="otest">
                    <p>Tests that pertain to <em>optional</em> Reading System functionality are
                        preceded by a "locator box" that looks like this: <span class="test-id"
                            >Test-002</span></p>
                </div>
            </dd>
            <dt>2. Performing the test</dt>
            <dd>Following each "locator box" is a description of what the given test is about, and then the actual <strong>test 
                    statement, which can always be evaluated to true or false</strong>. These statements
                typically have the form "If [some condition], the test passes".</dd>
        </dl>
