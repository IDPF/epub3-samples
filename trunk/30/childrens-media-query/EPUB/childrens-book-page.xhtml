      <h1>The Swans.</h1>
      <p>
        <span>“Ho! pretty swans,</span>
        <span>Do you know, in our Zoo’</span>
        <span>The swans of old England</span>
        <span>Are just like you?”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>“Don't tell me!”</span>
        <span>Said a cross old bird;</span>
        <span>“I know better,</span>
        <span>The thing's quite absurd.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Their figures, I’m sure,</span>
        <span>Are not worth a glance:</span>
        <span>If you want to see style,</span>
        <span>You <em>must</em> come to France.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>With a scornful whisk</span>
        <span>The swan turned tail,</span>
        <span>Spread its wings to the breeze</span>
        <span>And was off full-sail.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>“Ho! pretty swan,</span>
        <span>Do you know, in our Zoo’</span>
        <span>The swans are not half</span>
        <span>So conceited as you?”</span>
