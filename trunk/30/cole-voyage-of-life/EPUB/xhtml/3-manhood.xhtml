                <p>In the next painting, Manhood, the youth has grown into an adult and now faces
                    the trials of life. The boat is damaged and the tiller is gone. The river has
                    become a terrible rush of white water with menacing rocks, dangerous whirlpools,
                    and surging currents. The warm sunlight of youth has been clouded over with dark
                    and stormy skies and torrential rains. The trees have become wind-beaten,
                    gnarled, leafless trunks. The fresh grass is gone, replaced by hard and
                    unforgiving rock.</p><br/>
                <p>In the boat, the man no longer displays confidence or even control. The angel
                    appears high in the sky, still watching over the man, who does not see the
                    angel. Man must rely on his faith that the angel is there to help him. Cole
                    states, "Trouble is characteristic of the period of Manhood. In childhood, there
                    is no carking care: in youth, no despairing thought. It is only when experience
                    has taught us the realities of the world, that we lift from our eyes the golden
                    veil of early life; that we feel deep and abiding sorrow: and in the Picture,
                    the gloomy, eclipse-like tone, the conflicting elements, the trees riven by
                    tempest, are the allegory; and the Ocean, dimly seen, figures the end of life,
                    which the Voyager is now approaching."</p>
