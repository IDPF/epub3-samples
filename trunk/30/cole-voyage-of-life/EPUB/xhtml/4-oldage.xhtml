                <p>The final painting, Old Age, is an image of death. The man has grown old; he has
                    survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed; the river flows into the
                    waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered
                    boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time.</p>
                <br />
                <p> In the distance, angels are descending from heaven, while the guardian angel
                    hovers close, gesturing toward the others. The man is once again joyous with the
                    knowledge that faith has sustained him through life. The landscape is
                    practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly
                    world, and dark water stretches onward.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Cole describes the scene: "The chains of corporeal existence are falling away;
                    and already the mind has glimpses of Immortal Life."</p>
