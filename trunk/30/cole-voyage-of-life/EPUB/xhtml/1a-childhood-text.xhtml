        <p>In the first painting, Childhood, all the important story elements of the series are
            introduced: the voyager, the angel, the river, and the expressive landscape.</p>
        <p>An infant is safely ensconced in a boat guided by an angel. The landscape is lush;
            everything is calm and basking in warm sunshine, reflecting the innocence and joy of
            childhood.</p>
        <p>The boat glides out of a dark, craggy cave which Cole himself described as <q
                cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voyage_of_Life#endnote_Powella">emblematic of
                our earthly origin, and the mysterious Past</q>. The river is smooth and narrow,
            symbolizing the sheltered experience of childhood. The figurehead on the prow holds an
            hourglass representing time.</p>
