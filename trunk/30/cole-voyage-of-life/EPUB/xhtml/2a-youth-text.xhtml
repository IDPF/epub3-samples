        <h2>Youth</h2>
                <p>The second painting, Youth, shows the same rich, green landscape, but here the
                    view widens as does the voyager's experience. Now the youth grabs the tiller
                    firmly as the angel watches and waves from the shore, allowing him to take
                    control. The boy's enthusiasm and energy is evident in his forward-thrusting
                    pose and billowing clothes. In the distance, a ghostly castle hovers in the sky,
                    a white and shimmering beacon that represents the ambitions and dreams of
                    man.</p>

                <p>To the youth, the calm river seems to lead straight to the castle,
                    but at the far right of the painting one can just glimpse the river as it
                    becomes rough, choppy, and full of rocks. Cole comments on the landscape and the
                    youth's ambitions: "The scenery of the picture--its clear stream, its lofty
                    trees, its towering mountains, its unbounded distance, and transparent
                    atmosphere--figure forth the romantic beauty of youthful imaginings, when the
                    mind elevates the Mean and Common into the Magnificent, before experience
                    teaches what is the Real."</p>
