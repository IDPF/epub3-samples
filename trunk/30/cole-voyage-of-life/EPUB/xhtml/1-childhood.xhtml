                <p>In the first painting, Childhood, all the important story elements of the series
                    are introduced: the voyager, the angel, the river, and the expressive landscape.

                    lush; everything is calm and basking in warm sunshine, reflecting the innocence
                    and joy of childhood. The boat glides out of a dark, craggy cave which Cole

                <p>--> The river is smooth and narrow, symbolizing the sheltered experience of
                    childhood. The figurehead on the prow holds an hourglass representing time.</p>
