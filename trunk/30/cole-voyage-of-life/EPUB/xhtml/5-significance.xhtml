        <h2>Cultural significance</h2>
        <p>"The Voyage of Life" was well received by critics and the public; the United States was
            experiencing the religious revival sometimes known as the Second Great Awakening. The
            four paintings were converted to engravings by James Smillie (1807â€“1885) after Cole's
            death and the engravings widely distributed in time for the Third Great Awakening,
            giving the series the prestige and popular acclaim it retains today.</p>
