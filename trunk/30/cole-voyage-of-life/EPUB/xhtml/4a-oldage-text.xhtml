        <h2>Old Age</h2>
        <p>The final painting, Old Age, is an image of death. The man has grown old; he has survived
            the trials of life. The waters have calmed; the river flows into the waters of eternity.
            The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old
            voyager has reached the end of earthly time.</p>

        <p> In the distance, angels are descending from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers
            close, gesturing toward the others. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that
            faith has sustained him through life. The landscape is practically gone, just a few
            rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches
            onward.</p>
        <p>Cole describes the scene: "The chains of corporeal existence are falling away; and
            already the mind has glimpses of Immortal Life."</p>
