        <h2>Manhood</h2>
        
        <p>In the next painting, Manhood, the youth has grown into an adult and now faces the trials
            of life. The boat is damaged and the tiller is gone. The river has become a terrible
            rush of white water with menacing rocks, dangerous whirlpools, and surging currents. The
            warm sunlight of youth has been clouded over with dark and stormy skies and torrential
            rains. The trees have become wind-beaten, gnarled, leafless trunks. The fresh grass is
            gone, replaced by hard and unforgiving rock.</p>

        <p>In the boat, the man no longer displays confidence or even control. The angel appears
            high in the sky, still watching over the man, who does not see the angel. Man must rely
            on his faith that the angel is there to help him. Cole states, "Trouble is
            characteristic of the period of Manhood. In childhood, there is no carking care: in
            youth, no despairing thought. It is only when experience has taught us the realities of
            the world, that we lift from our eyes the golden veil of early life; that we feel deep
            and abiding sorrow: and in the Picture, the gloomy, eclipse-like tone, the conflicting
            elements, the trees riven by tempest, are the allegory; and the Ocean, dimly seen,
            figures the end of life, which the Voyager is now approaching."</p>
        <p>Within the painting Manhood there is a strong emphasis on the diagonal: in the rocks
            which jut up, steep and forbidding, and the river which sweeps downward, threatening to
            carry anything in or on it over the precipitous drop to the twisting and foaming rapids
            in the mid-ground. The extreme narrowness of the passage between the two rock face
            heightens the tension as the viewer tries to determine whether or not a small craft
            could navigate these tumultuous waters. In addition, evil spirits stare down from the
            dark clouds above.</p>
        <p>It is only in the distant background that the viewer captures a glimpse of the horizon.
            This line, where the distant ocean meets the sunset colored sky, is the only horizontal
            line in the painting. Amidst the chaos and confusion of the wild scene in the
            foreground, one catches a glimpse of possible serenity. Cole has positioned this focal
            point just below and to the right of center. The combination of the lone horizontal and
            warm color in an otherwise dark and forbidding scene, beckons the viewer’s eye back
            again and again.</p>
        <p>The silhouette of a gnarled tree trunk opposes the diagonals of the rocks and river,
            forcing the eye back into the scene. Here the twisted and rotting trunk is used, as it
            often is in Cole’s work, as a symbol for the savage (untamed) wilderness and all its
            dangers. The funnel-shaped cloud that appears above the tree leads the eye up into the
            forbidding clouds of the sky, over the top and to the left, where the downward arc of
            the clouds forces it back down again into the river.</p>
