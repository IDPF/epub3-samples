00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What does it mean to be human if we don't have a shared culture?

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What does a shared culture mean if we can't share it?

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's only in the last 100, or 150 years or so,

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That we started tightly restricting how that culture gets used.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The Internet enabled an infrastructure where anybody could participate without asking permission.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We have all these new technologies that allow people to express themselves,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
take control of their own creative impulses, but the law's getting in the way.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Creative Commons is designed to save the world from failed sharing.

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
People who actually want to share stuff.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Who put it up on the web because they want to share it under certain terms.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So we wanted to create a simple way, for creators

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to say to the world here's the freedom  that I want to run with my creative work.

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Here are the things you're allowed to do.

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Can I reproduce it, can I copy it, can I put it in my text book?

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Can I use that photograph? Can I make a new version of it?

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Creative Commons gives tools to creators to make a choice about copyright.

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Creative Commons license can cover anything that copyright covers.

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Every license says "You need to give me attribution".

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
"I created this, give me credit for the work I did."

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The basic choices are commercial use, or not.

21
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Can you make derivative works, versions, adaptations or not?

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And do you want me to have to share alike?

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So if I take your stuff, do I have to offer it to the next person under the same terms?

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
There's no requirement for you to do anything with your work other than what you want to do.

25
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You own the copyright to it.  What we've done is given you the right to exercise your copyright in more ways, more simply.

26
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So the idea here is to enable the creative impulses that the technology turns loose,

27
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and get the law out of the way.

28
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The work of Creative Commons is really about laying the infrastructure and ground work for this new type of culture.

29
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
A new kind of Folk Culture.

30
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Somebody from Deli, somebody from New York, somebody from Singapore,

31
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
can feel comfortable using photo that was created and given away by somebody in The United States, or in China,

32
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
or wherever that the licenses have been extended to.

33
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
With their identity being preserved.

34
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Which means that people can actually create new kinds of things,

35
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
come together and build things.

36
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Mash-ups that people can do with peoples Flicker photos.

37
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And CCmixter has allowed artists to make music together.

38
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's really about creativity and connection.

39
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Access and control.

40
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
From amateurs who simply for the love of what they are doing and they want to share it and they want other people to be able to make use of it,

41
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to commercial organizations.

42
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
In the end, this will have a very successful place in the for profit economy

43
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Creative Commons is the bridge to this future.

44
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You've got to move away from thinking about content to thinking about communities.

45
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Communities that develop around content

46
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and the sharing that the licenses allow enable these communities to come together.

47
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
A physical Commons  like a park where anybody can enter equally

48
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
A Commons with intellectual works is actually much freer

49
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It really is going to be the pillar for communications between people, cultural exchanges.

50
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The space for more speech, more free expression

51
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And that's the kind of Commons we're trying to create.

52
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Creative Commons
