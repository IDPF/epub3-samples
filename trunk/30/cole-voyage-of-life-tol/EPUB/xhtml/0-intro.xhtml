        <h1>The Voyage of Life</h1>
        <p><em>The Voyage of Life</em> series, painted by Thomas Cole in 1842, is a series of
            paintings that represent an allegory of the four stages of human life: childhood, youth,
            manhood, and old age.</p>
        <p> The paintings follow a voyager who travels in a boat on a river through the mid-19th
            century American wilderness. In each painting, accompanied by a guardian angel, the
            voyager rides the boat on the River of Life. The landscape, corresponding to the seasons
            of the year, plays a major role in telling the story.</p>
        <p>In each picture, the boat's direction of travel is reversed from the previous picture. In
            childhood, the infant glides from a dark cave into a rich, green landscape. As a youth,
            the boy takes control of the boat and aims for a shining castle in the sky. In manhood,
            the adult relies on prayer and religious faith to sustain him through rough waters and a
            threatening landscape. Finally, the man becomes old and the angel guides him to heaven
            across the waters of eternity.</p>

            <p>Thomas Cole is regarded as the founder of the Hudson River School, an American art
                movement that flourished in the mid-19th century and was concerned with the
                realistic and detailed portrayal of nature but with a strong influence from
                Romanticism. This group of American landscape painters worked between about 1825
                and 1870 and shared a sense of national pride as well as an interest in celebrating
                the unique natural beauty found in the United States. The wild, untamed nature found
                in America was viewed as its special character; Europe had ancient ruins, but
                America had the uncharted wilderness. As Cole's friend William Cullen Bryant
                sermonized in verse, so Cole sermonized in paint. Both men saw nature as God's work
                and as a refuge from the ugly materialism of cities. Cole clearly intended the
                Voyage of Life to be a didactic, moralizing series of paintings using the landscape
                as an allegory for religious faith.</p>
            <p>Unlike Coleâ€™s first major series, The Course of Empire, which focused on the stages
                of civilization as a whole, the Voyage of Life series is a more personal, Christian
                allegory that interprets visually the journey of man through four stages of life:
                infancy, youth, manhood and old age. Done on commission, the finished works
                generated a disagreement with the owner about a public exhibition. In 1842 when Cole
                was in Rome he did a second set of the series which on his return to America was
                shown to acclaim. The first set is at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in
                Utica, New York, the second set is at the National Gallery of Art in Washington,
                D.C.</p>
